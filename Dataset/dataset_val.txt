User: That's a lot of touchdowns! Especially considering how the points are calculated. There's a former Patriots player who never fumbled the ball in his career
Bot: How long was his career? ha ha! There has only been one Quarterback that was left handed. 
 <|endoftext|> 
User: I've heard that! Another funny aspect of football is that the superimposed yellow line for the first down won ESPN an Emmy
Bot: You know i gotta say they deserve it i was very appreciative of that line. Correction that high scoring game was played in 1916 by Georgia Tech and Cumberland. 
 <|endoftext|> 
User: It would be in college football. It's interesting how the interpretation of the name depends on the region. In some countries, football is understood as what Americans know as soccer
Bot: Yeah you're right and in others like Australia it's considered Rugby. 
 <|endoftext|> 
User: I think there's a difference between rugby and Australian rules football. There's even a variation known as Gaelic football
Bot: Yeah apparently there are so many different variations that they have football codes. You know Trump with all his money doesn't rate as one of the wealthiest presidents. 
 <|endoftext|> 
User: I guess JFK, Washington, and Jefferson all had more money. I wonder if with Washington and Jefferson, they had to calculate the hundreds of years of inflation to figure that out
Bot: Probably, Can you imagine Trump and Hillary Pres & VP. Apparently thats the way it was the runner up was automatically the VP. 
 <|endoftext|> 
User: Hello, do you like football?
Bot: I watch it every now and then, this latest Superbowl was very boring though.
 <|endoftext|> 
User: I didnt watch the latest one.  Thats too bad.  Did you know bowlers in the 60's made almost twice as much as football players?
Bot: Yeah and the university of Iowas locker room is all pink for visiting teams haha!
 <|endoftext|> 
User: Thats cool,  probably some scare tactic or mind game.  
Bot: And did you know that patriots rb benjarvus green-ellis never fumbled a football in his entire nfl career?
 <|endoftext|> 
User: Yeah I read that,  that is amazing!!  That has to be some kind of record lol 
Bot: Espn won an award for the creation of the superimposed yellow line representing the first down line in american football, that's pretty cool.
 <|endoftext|> 
User: That line is really helpful for people at home!  
Bot: So how do you feel about Kim Jong Un?
 <|endoftext|> 
User: Not a fan lol I think its funny that no one knows how old he actually is. 
Bot: If I had to venture a guess I would say early thirties, but that's just a guess and he isn't telling lol, he claims to have learned to drive at age 3.
 <|endoftext|> 
User: Yeah it says he was born in 1983,  but Korea has a different way of aging people.  So when you are born in Korea,  you are already one year old,  and the first year you have a korean new years,  you are 2 years old lol
Bot: Did you know The onion voted Kim jong Un as the sexiest man alive and the Chinese believes it? Talk about gullible ha!
 <|endoftext|> 
User: Who is the onion?
Bot: The Onion is an online news website that only post satire and joke news, so everything they report is fake, but a lot of people fall for it all the time, especially on Facebook.
 <|endoftext|> 
User: oooooh weird.  Yeah I dont believe he learned to drive at age 3 either!
Bot: He also has started to edit pictures to depict a different history just as previous leaders like stalin did.
 <|endoftext|> 
User: Seriously!  Apparently north korea is undergoing renovations of their theme parks under his orders.....priorities lol 
Bot: That is if the theme parks even exist at all! since they don't let anyone in to see we will never know.
 <|endoftext|> 
User: Ah thats true,  it could be all lies!  North Korea is a country I don't prefer to visit
Bot: Yeah, well it was nice chatting with you, have a good night.
 <|endoftext|> 
User: Did you realize Kim Jong Un  was born in 1983?
Bot: I did not, he's only one year older than me. One month, and one year to be precise.
 <|endoftext|> 
User: He is 9 months older than me.  Hes been running a country since 2011.  What have I been doing with my life..  lol
Bot: He's running a country while his older brother is going to Eric Clapton concerts. That doesn't seem right.
 <|endoftext|> 
User: I wonder why his older brother didnt take over for their father, or is it not like that?
Bot: I'm not sure. His half brother was favored to be the heir but fell out of favor when he was caught with a fake passport trying to enter Tokyo Disneyland.
 <|endoftext|> 
User: He is pretty violent, he even ordered his own Uncle to be executed.
Bot: I wonder if his uncle was a barber. I heard he cuts his own hair because he is scared of barbers.
 <|endoftext|> 
User: Is that a fear from childhood?  It seems odd that one wouldnt overcome something like that.
Bot: It is kind of odd. I wonder if he watched Sweeny Todd? I heard that he is renovating their theme parks.
 <|endoftext|> 
User: Then he just has to avoid Fleet Street, and hes all good!
Bot: That is right! It is good that him and Trump have been having talks. That hasn't happened in years.
 <|endoftext|> 
User: Hopefully those talks are productive and are good for the US.
Bot: I hope so too. Did you know that the only US President to have a PHD is Woodrow Wilson? I guess you don't have to be scholarly to be President. 
 <|endoftext|> 
User: I think our current president really proves that one.
Bot: I agree with that. Did you know that 5 presidents have been elected while still losing the popular vote? The greatest margin was 10%.
 <|endoftext|> 
User: Wow, I knew some lost the popular vote, but never knew the margin got that big.  Thats pretty incredible.
Bot: Yeah it is. Did you know Lincoln was the first president to be photographed for his inauguration and can you guess who else was in that photo?
 <|endoftext|> 
User: It was John WIlkes Booth!    How creepy.  
Bot: That is pretty creepy!
 <|endoftext|> 
User: I am curious to see where he was positioned in the photo, it is just so odd.
Bot: I would like to see that too. I'm going to have to research it.
 <|endoftext|> 
User: I mean, was the assassination planed out further than we think?  I wonder if they are in other photos together too.
Bot: I'm not sure, it is kind of eerie. Well I think I am going to have to go look into this now. I hope you have a good night!
 <|endoftext|> 
User: Hello.  Do watch any NFL games?
Bot: Yes, I'm a Chiefs fan.  I was surprised that the NFL has no rules against women playing.  Go girls!
 <|endoftext|> 
User: It is surprising.  Seeing as how no women play yet I assumed they did have rules against it.
Bot: I also can't believe that there is only 11 minutes of actual gameplay in an average NFL game.
 <|endoftext|> 
User: Is that right?  It seems like much longer. I mean, I know there's a lot of commercials and such but it still seems like the actual plays take a while and are more frequent.
Bot: I played in HS and there was a lot of standing around but that seems like too little time.  Maybe tracking chips in shoulder pads will help keep track of time better?
 <|endoftext|> 
User: Oh yeah, I've heard about that.  They are used to track a players every move on the field.  They are even in the footballs to track it's movements.  Do you think the teams get and use any of the information recorded?
Bot: Probably... Do you watch basketball?  In 39 of 50 states, the highest paid state employee is a college football or basketball coach.
 <|endoftext|> 
User: I watch some basketball but more football actually.  College football and basketball is great to watch!  Did you ever hear about the dunk shot being banned from college basketball for a while?
Bot: I think so... Kareem... Is it racist for New Zealand to call their basketball team the "Tall Blacks". It would be in the U.S. whether it was meant to be or not.
 <|endoftext|> 
User: I don' t think it's racist.  If the team is made up of tall people that are black then it is just descriptive.  What do you think?
Bot: I agree. I didn't know there was a basketball court on the top of the US Supreme Court building.  Dunk one Ruth Bader Ginsberg! 
 <|endoftext|> 
User: Yep! It's called the highest court in the land.  Somehow I have a hard time picturing a lot of the justices playing, not just her.
Bot: I sometimes have a hard time picturing them actually following the US Constitution. Do you keep track of NFL QBs?  Alex Smith must be smart.  He quizzed out of his first two years of college.
 <|endoftext|> 
User: I didn't know that about him.  I know he's a good quarterback though.  Baker Mayfield has some talent off the field as well. He considered being a pro gamer instead of quarterback.
Bot: I remember the circular huddle.  I didn't know that a deaf QB was its origin. 
 <|endoftext|> 
User: Oh yeah, someone told me that recently.  A team didn't want the other team to read his hand signals so they huddled up and the huddle was born.
Bot: I always thought it just to communicate verbally better. Did you know that Kellan Moore is the only left-handed QA in the NFL?
 <|endoftext|> 
User: No I didn't.  To be honest though, I've never paid attention to what hand they throw the ball out of.
Bot: Me either.  Times have changed with an NFL QB has to decide between football and video games.  Such is the plight for Baker Mayfield...
 <|endoftext|> 
User: Hello, do you watch the NFL?
Bot: Hi I sure do. Did you know women can play too?
 <|endoftext|> 
User: Yeah that is nice that there is no written rule against that, if you make the cut you play
Bot: Yeah that is true. Did you know the average game has only 11 minutes of active play
 <|endoftext|> 
User: Yeah and yet we are glued to the tv for hours waiting for it to end
Bot: Ah the irony if it. And engineers seems to make more money on the long run than them
 <|endoftext|> 
User: Yes, their careers are much longer so I guess that makes sense
Bot: Good point. Did you hear about that rule for New Orleans cheerleaders?
 <|endoftext|> 
User: Oh about not being able to eat in the same place as the players?
Bot: Yeah that is so sexist and outdated and I really think it needs to go now
 <|endoftext|> 
User: Yes and the worst part is that they have to leave mid meal if they walk in
Bot: Yes pretty rough.They are using tracking chips on the players now it seems
 <|endoftext|> 
User: Yeah and they are tracing velocity and speed and a bunch of other stuff with those
Bot: Yeah , I hope they can use those to make the game safer for the players too
 <|endoftext|> 
User: I hope so  too How about basketball, watch it much?
Bot: Sometimes I do. Do you know who made the dunk shot popular?
 <|endoftext|> 
User: Yes it was Kareem but he was also the reason why it was banned for a few years
Bot: Yeah that is true, he was just too good at it and it was for a good chunk, 10 years
 <|endoftext|> 
User: Yeah. Do you know who invented the sport of basketball?
Bot: Yes it was James Naismith and he is also the only losing coach at U of Kansas
 <|endoftext|> 
User: Wow what an irony really. The coaches are the highest paid though as far as state employees go
Bot: That is true in most states. have you heard of the highest court in the land?
 <|endoftext|> 
User: Hi 
Bot: Hi there. Are you a sports fan? 
 <|endoftext|> 
User: Yes i like football do like football
Bot: I liked it a lot in High school but tickets are so expensive now, so I just watch it on tv. I'm still wondering when a woman will start playing, since it isn't against the rules. 
 <|endoftext|> 
User: yeah me too i stop seeing NFL on TV  not trying to get tickets 
Bot: I guess the most logical place for a women to start would be as a kicker. Since the average game has only 11 minutes of live play, the kicker must only play for about 2 minutes a game!
 <|endoftext|> 
User: do you have favorite NFL  team where we can add a kicker 
Bot: I like the Cowboys and the Falcons. I was surprised to see that engineers make more than football players over their life time. I guess because most only play for a few years before they get hurt.
 <|endoftext|> 
User: i like Redskins 
Bot: Why do you think the Saints cheerleaders have to leave a restaurant if a player comes in? What's their reasoning?
 <|endoftext|> 
User: to avoid any gossip s and controversy probably
Bot: But why doesn't the player have to leave if the cheerleader comes in? It isn't fair. It's discrimination, don't you think?
 <|endoftext|> 
User: Totally unfair . But the NFL has business motives.
Bot: Did you study about James Naismith, the inventor of basketball, in school. I did and for some reason, I an still remember that name, even though I've never been a basketball fan. Funny that he was a the only losing coach at UK!
 <|endoftext|> 
User: i think he lost the match as a coach in kansas ,he is the only one to lose i guess
Bot: He didn't lose a match, he was the only losing coach in their history. That means he never had a season where they won more than they lost. I guess you don't know much about basketball either.
 <|endoftext|> 
User: yep poor me . but i know one thing there is a basket ball court on top of US supreme court building
Bot: Right! That is funny, 'the highest court in the land'. That's a good basketball joke. I wonder if the justices actually play up there in their robes, Ha Ha!
 <|endoftext|> 
User: I guess its safe till there is no football court above supreme court. They have to handle quarterbacks .. much worse
Bot: I don't know why the New Zealand basketball team is named the Tall Blacks. Do you?
 <|endoftext|> 
User: Not sure .. but they are associated with black uniforms in other sports too 
Bot: I never thought about New Zelanders being tall. Oh well. Funny that Tom Brady was a backup quarter back that Never got into a game, in high school! Boy, I bet they wish they could change that.
 <|endoftext|> 
User: Hi there, are you a football fan?
Bot: I was a big fan, age and other concerns have made me stop and you? I was reading about Adrian Peterson.
 <|endoftext|> 
User: Me too. I'm a Viking fan who is a bit conflicted about AP.
Bot: hahahah why?
 <|endoftext|> 
User: He was really fun to watch before I learned about his child abuse story.
Bot: Wow, was he abused? so sorry about that.
 <|endoftext|> 
User: No, he abused his son. He did play well last season though.
Bot: Wow! so terrible news. Perhaps he was abused, too. You know, those things happens as a cycle. I love quaterbacks, do you happen to have a favorite?
 <|endoftext|> 
User: Favorite to watch might be Aaron Rodgers at his best. How about you>
Bot: hahaha it was a long time ago Stabler, did you know him?
 <|endoftext|> 
User: Was stabler a cowboy?
Bot: No, from the evil Oakland's Raiders, perhaps you are too young. I think they are the most important player in the game, well, as well as receivers, etc. etc.
 <|endoftext|> 
User: Definitely. Crazy to think that Alex Smith worked to get a Masters Degree after getting a BA in just two years
Bot: He really worked hard. And he began working on a master´s degree!
 <|endoftext|> 
User: Has to do something after football, and he broke his leg badly this year so he might be done.
Bot: Well, but sure he has a lot of money left. I never knew that the circular huddle was invented for a deaft quaterback, so the other team could not read his hand signals, cool!
 <|endoftext|> 
User: Now they use both headsts and hand signals.
Bot: Did you know that the New Zealand's basketball team are nicknamed the "tall blacks"? I should google why later.
 <|endoftext|> 
User: Maybe they are referring to coffee
Bot: You are right. I don´t know, I like to investigate things, I will do it later, reading that the inventor of basketball James Naismith is the only losing coach in Kansas History. Poor guy!
 <|endoftext|> 
User: What's your favorite thing to watch on TV? I really like comedy shows.
Bot: I enjoy reality shows.  Did you ever watch Thomas the Tank Engine?  I saw that Ringo Starr, George Carlin, and Alec Baldwin have narrated 
 <|endoftext|> 
User: I like those shows, too! I've never seen much of the Thomas show. It must be very popular if those guys are involved. Maybe they'll have the President narrate sometime?
Bot: Yes, that would be neat.  I saw that there is only one episode of "The Simpsons where Bart neither appears nor is mentioned
 <|endoftext|> 
User: I watched the Simpon's a lot when I was younger. I think they've even done parodies of some of the US Presidents on that show. South Park was another good comedy cartoon TV show.
Bot: Yes I saw that when they aired their last episode that the Simpsons crew sent them flowers
 <|endoftext|> 
User: That's really nice! Do you think they ever watch the Simpson's at the President's house? Like his family and stuff?
Bot: Im not sure but I saw that the top three wealthiest presidents were JFK, Washington, and Jefferson
 <|endoftext|> 
User: Oh yes! Did you hear of the President of Indonesia and his three pop albums?
Bot: lol, thats funny.  I saw though that the first president of Zimbabwe was ccalled President Banana
 <|endoftext|> 
User: I wonder if President Banana had a feast of banana dishes and puddings at his inauguration? Does the US President still have a produce garden at the white house?
Bot: I am not sure about that but that would be nice.  Did you know that the US presidents guest house is larger than the White House
 <|endoftext|> 
User: That's pretty amazing! Was there ever a President to have his home on that MTV Cribs show?
Bot: That would be interesting.  Until 1805 in the US the runner up in a presidential elecction automatically became Vice President
 <|endoftext|> 
User: Do you think that's better than how they do the separate elections now? Do you think Trump would have wanted it to be Hillary as Vice? lol
Bot: Wow that would have been an interesting match up.  LOL.  Do you enjoy music?  I saw something about two identical twins from Japan released a rap album when turned 100 years old in 1992
 <|endoftext|> 
User: Have you heard about Do Nguyen Mai Khoi? She's the Vietnamese pop star that ran for President to raise awareness.
Bot: I didn't know about that.  I just read that even though this album was released over 40 years ago "The Dark Side of the Moon" is still one of the best selling albums of 2014
 <|endoftext|> 
User: Yes, such a great classic album; I've enjoyed listening to it many times! I was just gonna say that you should look that pop singer up. I wish America would have someone like her to actually run.
Bot: Did you know that Linkin Parks "Hybrid Theory" is the best selling album of the 21st century.
 <|endoftext|> 
User: Have you heard about singer Mai Khoi?
Bot: Is she that Vietnamese pop star that only performs in secret?  I just read an article about her.
 <|endoftext|> 
User: Yes, that is her.    I am glad she finally got to play some shows in Brooklyn.
Bot: That is cool. Did you know she ran for political office in Vietnam?
 <|endoftext|> 
User: Interesting.    Was that when she won the prize for Creative Dissent?
Bot: I do not think it was.  I think it was more for her lyrics.
 <|endoftext|> 
User: I would like to check out her album Dissent sometimes.
Bot: Did you know that unless one has the backing of the Communist party in Vietnam, there is no chance of winning an election?
 <|endoftext|> 
User: I am glad many places are republics with a President.
Bot: Me too.  Speaking of presidents, did you know that Lincoln was the first president to be photographed for his inauguration?
 <|endoftext|> 
User: That is interesting.    I wonder if JFK was photographed more frequently since he is so wealthy.
Bot: Maybe. Did you know that John Wilkes booth was also in that picture?
 <|endoftext|> 
User: Nope, did not know that.     Did you know the first president of Zimbabwe was called president Banana!
Bot: Really that is kind of awesome!  Did you know the only US president to have a Ph. D. was Woodrow Wilson?
 <|endoftext|> 
User: Must have been a smart guy.     Today he would probably appear on television.
Bot: Probably would. Since you brought up TV, did you know that the skit "Weekend Update" on SNL is their longest running skit?
 <|endoftext|> 
User: That is interesting.    It has been around longer than "The Simpsons", which is quite an accomplishment!
Bot: That is true!  Did you know that in the first 400 episodes of The Simpsons, Homer has had 188 jobs?
 <|endoftext|> 
User: Pretty funny.     There is only one episode of the Simpsons where Bart is not present and doesn't even get mentioned!
Bot: Really, I had not idea.  Did you know that in the episode Treehouse of Horror XXI Daniel Radcliffe voiced the parody of Edward Cullen?
 <|endoftext|> 
User: Pretty amazing.    I think I will go watch that South Park episode admired by the Simpsons crew!
Bot: That is cool. Nice chatting with you have a good day!
 <|endoftext|> 
User: Have you heard of Do Nguyen Mai Khoi?
Bot: No, who is he?
 <|endoftext|> 
User: She is a Vietnamese pop star that is considered an enemy of the state due to her song lyrics.
Bot: That's interesting. I do know that Bob Marley has been on the album chart for 914 weeks.
 <|endoftext|> 
User: Really! I had no idea!  What do you think of Linkin Park's album being the best selling of the 21st century?
Bot: I never would have thought of that. I would've thought it would be Jackson or Elvis. That is one of my favorite bands. I am still shocked and sad the lead singer commited suicide.
 <|endoftext|> 
User: I know, that was a big shock.  Record album charts are a strange thing indeed.  I mean, Dark Side of the Moon is still one of the best selling albums.
Bot: Floyd is another one of my favorite bands. Do you like Aerosmith? I heard they made more money from the video game guitar hero than any of their albums.
 <|endoftext|> 
User: I do and I've heard that too! I guess it's just a sign of the times changing.  Vinyl LPs are hardly sold anymore.
Bot: I had them when I was younger. My wife and I finally trashed them because they were so heavy when the boxes were full of them when we moved to new houses. Wish we hadn't would probably make a lot of money selling them today.
 <|endoftext|> 
User: You probably would have. They are collectors items to some people.  Some of the really old ones are 78-rpm records in a book.
Bot: I never had them. I had the 35s when I was really young as a kid. Did you know Walmart only sells clean versions of albums and if the artist won't make one they won't sell it?
 <|endoftext|> 
User: I knew they banned certain magazines and books but not albums.  I guess that can be a good thing when you think of all of the kids in the stores.
Bot: I had audio cassettes from the 70s into the first decade of the 2000s. But got rid of them too. I think it is neat that you can just tell Siri to play a song and she'll play the song. World is a lot different from when I was a kid.
 <|endoftext|> 
User: I hear you there.  Now, even elected officials make albums.  I mean, the president of indonesia made 3 pop albums.
Bot: Wonder if an audiobook is considered an an album. If so the audio version of the Art of the Deal would be his. Don't think any other sitting presidents have albums.
 <|endoftext|> 
User: None come to mind at the moment. Presidents have different functions though depending on the form of government so that president may have a lighter role than others.
Bot: I was surprised that five US presidents have been elected while still losing the popular vote. The greatest margin was 10%.
 <|endoftext|> 
User: Even more surprising is that the runner up used to become the vice president.
Bot: Wow, can you imagine Trump and Hillary working together? That would've been crazy. SNL would have a blast with that. Did you know Weekend Update was on the first episode and is their longest running skit?
 <|endoftext|> 
User: hey there what is your favorite music album?
Bot: I enjoy listening to most albums such as the dark side of the moon or Frank sinatra's hits like fly me to the moon
 <|endoftext|> 
User: oh ya Pink floyd is awesome! I'm glad that ya dark side of the moon is still a best selling record even today
Bot: I think great music is timeless and always appreciated by future generations
 <|endoftext|> 
User: ya I think so, did you hear about the Japanese 100 year old rapping twins?
Bot: I bit. Tell me more
 <|endoftext|> 
User: well they made an album when they both turned 100, its a rap album and came out in 1992, it sounds wacky to me
Bot: It is cool those twins did something memorable together, though I have no clue how the music itself was. I wonder if they aired an accompanying music video on tv
 <|endoftext|> 
User: ya I agree, I bet it was nowhere near as good as NWA's straight outta compton
Bot: Do you watch anything lately on tv?
 <|endoftext|> 
User: well I always watch south park and I have seen Stranger things and Game of thrones, what about you?
Bot: I also enjoy south park. I recently went back to see the 70's show and part of the simpsons
 <|endoftext|> 
User: ya I want to watch that one episode of the simpsons, you know where bart doesnt appear at all
Bot: Not really, but I am sure you could look it up. I personally like the episode with the 3 eyed fish
 <|endoftext|> 
User: oh ya I remember that, Blinky was his name, did you ever watch pokemon?
Bot: Yes I used to watch it on kids WB. I wonder how many episodes they have now. It is still continuing
 <|endoftext|> 
User: oh its probably like 800, I would never be able to catch up and thus "catch em all" haha
Bot: I think they actually passed 1000 a while ago. In any case, it is one show that would be hard to binge watch in one sitting
 <|endoftext|> 
User: oh for sure, did you ever watch that 70s show? I binged some of that the other day
Bot: I do enjoy it. It is too bad the UK remake was canceled so early
 <|endoftext|> 
User: yup, cancelled after only 10 episodes, thats embarrassing!
Bot: In any case, I had a wonderful chat and I hope you see that simpson's episode devoid of bart. I think homer would lose his meaning in life in that episode.
 <|endoftext|> 
User: Do you follow football at all these days?
Bot: Hello there, I do like to follow football, my team didn't make the playoffs this year so that was sad.  How about you?
 <|endoftext|> 
User: I'm very sorry to hear this. I'm a huge New England Patriots fan and we won the Super Bowl this year.
Bot: Nice!  Yeah you guys have been dominating for a while now it has been impressive.  
 <|endoftext|> 
User: I was very surprised too be honest there was a time where I didn't think we will make the playoffs because we kept loosing our away games.
Bot: Yeah and as long as you make it, you have a chance.  Speaking of football, did you know that Snoop Dogg once wrote a fight song for his own son's school team?
 <|endoftext|> 
User: No I didn't know this but I was really impressed with Deshaun Watson this year. He beat the Dallas Cowboys in overtime back in October by racking up 415 yards. That's impressive!!!
Bot: That is really impressive.  He was just 23 years old as well, wow!
 <|endoftext|> 
User: Yeah!! He kinda reminds me of Aaron Rodgers because he scrambles a lot with the intention of buying time to find the open receiver down field. Now that is a great quarterback.
Bot: Yeah he is a bit like him.  Aaron Rodgers has been the quarterback of my team since he came into the league actually. 
 <|endoftext|> 
User: You're a Packers fan. I love the Packers and I always rooting for them when they are not playing the Patriots.
Bot: Yeah well when we had old Brett at the helm his best moment was agains your Pats, so that's good memories.  I have to hold on to those because we have sucked the last two years lol. 
 <|endoftext|> 
User: I think your team will be great next season because healthy Rodgers is always a fantastic Rodgers in my opinion.
Bot: Thanks I sure hope so, speaking of QB's do you know who the only one to ever throw a td to himself was?
 <|endoftext|> 
User: I think it was Alex Smith if I'm not mistaking.
Bot: Nope, but that was a good guess.  It was Brad Johnson, who won a superbowl himself. 
 <|endoftext|> 
User: Wow I didn't know this. I heard somewhere that the 1960's top bowlers made twice as much as football stars.
Bot: I think I have heard that too funny!  I guess it just shows how big the NFL has gotten since then.
 <|endoftext|> 
User: Yes. The NFL is huge these days and the fans are very passionate about their teams.
Bot: Yeah they sure are, even at the high school level.  Did you know that there is a high school stadium in Texas that seats 18,000?!
 <|endoftext|> 
User: No. I didn't know this. Very interesting.
Bot: Yeah very interesting, I guess it cost $60 million to build, that sounds nuts to me. 
 <|endoftext|> 
User: Wow that is a lot of money.
Bot: Yeah that sure is for a high school stadium.  Well it's been good talking with you, hope you have a good night!
 <|endoftext|> 
User: Man, that Deshaun Watson can run.  Reminds me of Michael Vick.
Bot: He is with the Dallas Cowboys, isn't he?
 <|endoftext|> 
User: Houston. But the Dallas guy can run too.They are both dangerous out side the pocket, as Jay Gruden has said, but I wonder if this can last in the long run...given the injury risk.
Bot: Is Watson a quarterback?
 <|endoftext|> 
User: yeah.  they had a losing record but are 9-6 under watson, 
Bot: Do you like Tom Brady?
 <|endoftext|> 
User: yeah, but brady cant run.plus, the patriots are great...one guy never fumbled
Bot: You are talking about Green-Ellis, correct?
 <|endoftext|> 
User: yeah...thats his name. they are so good someone should paint their locker room pink to even things out.
Bot: Apparently, The University Iowa's locker room for visiting football teams is painted pink.
 <|endoftext|> 
User: yeah...thats what i was thinking of. smart move. alex smith - smart. he took a lot of ap classes in high school.
Bot: He got his bachelor's degree in two years!
 <|endoftext|> 
User: wow. he can run too. maybe not home run ability running that puts defenses in an awkward spot, but its a weapon.
Bot: You know a lot about football.
 <|endoftext|> 
User: Thats. I read about it a lot. i like reading, exercises the mind
Bot: That's good.  Apparently ESPN won an emmy.
 <|endoftext|> 
User: for their yellow-line thingie? 
Bot: Yes.  I cannot imagine watching football games without seeing the superimposed yellow line.
 <|endoftext|> 
User: does the university of Iowa use a pink one?
Bot: I don't think so.  They painted visiting teams' locker room pink.
 <|endoftext|> 
User: yeah..i was just goofing on them. well, i gotta run like vick soon.
Bot: Are you as fast as Michael Vick?  Anyway, it was nice chatting with you.  Bye.
 <|endoftext|> 
User: do you watch the NFL?
Bot: I do. Do you like Brady?
 <|endoftext|> 
User: Yes I do. Did you know he was a backup QB in high school?
Bot: Yes and they never started him, too weird
 <|endoftext|> 
User: Yes they lost a lot of talent there and a chance to win a game
Bot: Yeah. .Do you now who ALex SMith is?
 <|endoftext|> 
User: Yeah. Do you know who invented the circular huddle?
Bot: Yes that was Paul Hubbard and he was deaf. Do you know why he invented it?
 <|endoftext|> 
User: Yes because he sis not want the other team to read his gestures
Bot: SO smart. Baker Mayfield once thought of quitting football? DO you know why?
 <|endoftext|> 
User: Yes he wanted to become a competitive gamer
Bot: Yeah. U of Iowan painted the visitor locker room pink.
 <|endoftext|> 
User: Yes I wonder if that is supposed to have some impact on them 
Bot: I wonder too. Do you know what he highest score in college football is?
 <|endoftext|> 
User: That was 222-0  with Georgia Tech beating Cumberland
Bot: Yeah. Bowlers make more money in the 60s than football players
 <|endoftext|> 
User: Yes it was not that popular of a sport back in the day
Bot: Yesh. Did you know ESPN won an Emmy once?
 <|endoftext|> 
User: yes they won it for the superimposed yellow line
Bot: Yeah , it has made watching games easier. It was really nice chatting with you today.
 <|endoftext|> 
User: Hi, how are you doing this evening?
Bot: Good, just been doing some reading for fun. I typically read novels, which when they spread in the 18th century, caused a "moral panic"
 <|endoftext|> 
User: People get so concerned about anything that's popular. Like video games. Have they destroyed America's youth? Hm.
Bot: Sometimes I wonder the same thing, but I know there are games that require a lot of reading. I know some people who have even learned some foreign language from video games. I suspect that Anne Jones doesn't hold the record for speed reading from playing games though
 <|endoftext|> 
User: No, she wouldn't. I wonder how long it took her to achieve that reading rate. And how much she retains.
Bot: I'm not sure, but 4,700 words a minute is impressive. I'm glad reading hasn't become outdated though. US military branches have reading lists, and Starship Troopers is on three of the five lists, the first of sci-fi to make it
 <|endoftext|> 
User: Heinlein was in the military, and I guess his books help get the troops interested in strategy and stuff.
Bot: There's a lot that can be learned form books. Many, including the Marines, have Ender's Game as suggested reading
 <|endoftext|> 
User: Anything to get the troops reading for fun. I think they have downtime and they want people to keep their minds active. No moral panic in the military because of SF novels.
Bot: And it's beneficial. Not only does it teach strategy, but it also promotes critical analysis and creativity
 <|endoftext|> 
User: That's very true. Better than just sitting around watching football on TV.
Bot: I do enjoy football on occasion though. I wouldn't be able to keep up with the game as well if it weren't for the superimposed line for the first down invented by ESPN
 <|endoftext|> 
User: That line seems so obvious now. I still don't know about winning an award for it.
Bot: We're so used to it now, and no one thought to do it, so now they have an Emmy for it
 <|endoftext|> 
User: I'm a bit surprised that bowlers made so much money in the 60s. I guess more people knew the sports and there were sponsors or something.
Bot: That's possible. Plus, television wasn't very popular then, and it's hard to watch a football game without all the camera angles. Still, I wonder if it would have been entertaining or boring to watch the 1916 Georgia Tech game against Cumberland. 220 is a lot of touchdowns!
 <|endoftext|> 
User: I hope that the GT team used their third string. That score seems punitive. Plus I wonder who bet on the game.
Bot: I wonder who their QB was. Or maybe their RB was as talented as Green-Ellis who went through his NFL career without a fumble
 <|endoftext|> 
User: Cumberland probably fumbled on every play. Well, I enjoyed chatting!
Bot: That seems likely. Yikes!
 <|endoftext|> 
User: Have a good night!
Bot: You too! Back to reading
 <|endoftext|> 
User: I was sorry to hear in the news recently that C. Payne Lucas has passed away.
Bot: Yea, bit she was 85 and had a pretty productive life
 <|endoftext|> 
User: He had a life to be proud of, doing a lot of great work providing aid to people all across Africa.
Bot: Yea, he founded Africare in 1971. 
 <|endoftext|> 
User: It's amazing that he did so much after not only getting a college degree, but also taking a break from his studies to serve in the military.
Bot: Yea pretty amazing for a guy that started out picking cotton and shinning shoes.
 <|endoftext|> 
User: Maybe the way he worked so hard to rise in life was the inspiration for him trying to help others do the same.
Bot: Yea, and had to be a long life to outlive his sin who died in 2013 and his daughter who dies in 2017.
 <|endoftext|> 
User: It's sad to think he would have to see his children pass away, but I hope he got to enjoy time with his two grandchildren.
Bot: Yea, I hope so as well. I know off topic but dis you know JFK, Washington and Jefferson were our richest presidents. 
 <|endoftext|> 
User: That makes sense, since Washington and Jefferson were landowners, and JFK was from a wealthy family. I'm surprised no recent presidents are on the list, though.
Bot: Maybe they should release a pop album like the president of Indonesia.
 <|endoftext|> 
User: I think if the current president did that, it would either bomb terribly or become a chart topper.
Bot: My luck people would like it and every time I turned in the radio I would have to have to hear him. 
 <|endoftext|> 
User: Maybe the entire government should start releasing debate opinions in songs. Congressional rap battle? Supreme court opera?
Bot: Lol, I can see Bernie now, first album, Free Healthcare Foos
 <|endoftext|> 
User: And the Mitch McConnell retort, The Capitalism Rap.
Bot: Lol. They could have their music studios in Nevada since the government owns 86% of the land there.
 <|endoftext|> 
User: People might actually start tuning in to the government debates on TV.
Bot: Republicans vs democrats rap battle.
 <|endoftext|> 
User: Hey! How are you doing? I find it funny that the first President of Zimbabwe was called President Banana! 
Bot: Hi! That is funny!  I wonder if banana has a different meaning in their language.  Say, did you know that fdr was the last of our presidents that can speak a foreign language?
 <|endoftext|> 
User: It might. Or it could actually be his last name. I didn't know that about FDR. I did learn that the top 3 wealthiest Presidents are JFK, Washington, and Jefferson.
Bot: Washington and Jefferson are two of the wealthiest?  I guess I can see Jefferson but I thought Washington was a general.
 <|endoftext|> 
User: I thought so too. Maybe he became wealthy as a President? I wonder if the President of Indonesia is wealthy- they released 3 pop albums while in office!
Bot: You know he just might be! That could be the whole reason he did it, to make money.  Our presidents have been rich but not smart.  The last one to have a phd was woodrow wilson.
 <|endoftext|> 
User: Interesting! And unfortunately I do agree with you. And not very philanthropic... the Norwegian government donated $1 billion to help save the Amazon rain forest. I couldn't see our own gov't do that. 
Bot: No, I can't see them doing that either.  They'd be more like the chinese government who censored the word censorship.
 <|endoftext|> 
User: Haha very true. Did you know that a French man impersonated a government official and managed to sell the Eiffel Tower twice!?
Bot: No I didn't! He did that twice! Once is bad enough. I can't believe he got away with it again.
 <|endoftext|> 
User: Yes twice! Amazing. And speaking of bans, Wikileaks published the gov't's plan to destroy Wikileaks. Makes me feel like they have a lot to hide.
Bot: They probably do.  On the flip side they do publish full names of anyone that chooses to renounce their citizenship.
 <|endoftext|> 
User: That's interesting. Sounds like they are trying to create a witch hunt against people who seem "unpatriotic." In 2006, the US passed legislation that would protect gov't employees from being persecuted for violating Geneva conventions.
Bot: Nice way to protect themselves if you ask me.  They get protected a lot.  Back in 1895 J.P. Morgan bailed the government out.
 <|endoftext|> 
User: I agree. Off topic, have you ever watched the Simpsons?
Bot: I've watched a few shows.  It seems like it's been on a long time.
 <|endoftext|> 
User: A very long time! There is only 1 episode where Bart is never mentioned, or appears.
Bot: Just one?  He's obviously very important to the show.  Hasn't homer had a lot of jobs?  I think I read somewhere that he's had over a hundred.
 <|endoftext|> 
User: Haha really? I didn't know that! I thought he always worked at the nuclear plant.
Bot: Yeah, if i remember right it was all in the first 400 jobs that he had the different jobs.
 <|endoftext|> 
User: Do you watch any television?
Bot: I do enjoy watching television. What about you?
 <|endoftext|> 
User: I love my TV shows. I like south park, you ever watch that?
Bot: South Park always annoyed me. I have watched quite a bit of pokemon though. 
 <|endoftext|> 
User: For sure, when south park made fun of family guy, the simpsons sent them flowers. I like pokemon too
Bot: I have kids so I watch a lot of cartoons mostly on PBS like wild kratts and Thomas the tank. 
 <|endoftext|> 
User: nice they ever watch some of the 750 episodes of pokemon. I love thomas the tank also!
Bot: I like the ones narrated by Alec Baldwin the best. He just has one of those voices made for narration. 
 <|endoftext|> 
User: Nice, I liked those a lot. Mine was Ringo Starr ones, he has that thomas the tank type voice
Bot: That's true. Very gravelly and engine like. It is crazy how far tvs have come even in just a few short years though. I remember watching cartoons in black and white. 
 <|endoftext|> 
User: dang, I remember saturday morning cartoons. Did you ever watch that 70s show?
Bot: Yes! That show was hilarious. Too bad the sequels and spinoffs tanked so terribly. 
 <|endoftext|> 
User: right, I heard the one in UK only lasted 10 episodes, and that 80s show was a bust too!
Bot: I think the UK one probably wasn't as popular because it was a very american humor show not really the british dry wit. 
 <|endoftext|> 
User: For sure, there is two different kinds of comedy right there. It is just like the office in british vs american
Bot: I think the british office was on for ages longer than the american one. I never really got that one. Designated survivor is a good one though. 
 <|endoftext|> 
User: Never heard of that one, what is that about?
Bot: It is about a man who becomes president after the capitol is blown up. 
 <|endoftext|> 
User: I will have to check that out. Speaking of capitol hill, are you a trump fan?
Bot: I respect the office and what his intentions were but I'm not a fan of how he is going about it. What about you?
 <|endoftext|> 
User: That is a great way to put it. I think if he released an album like the president of indonesia did he would be more popular, lol
Bot: I dont' think the US would handle it well if he did that. He is already controversial. That might push his advesaries over the edge. 
 <|endoftext|> 
User: I like watching the NFL - football is the best of the 4 major professional sports.
Bot: I agree. It's much more interesting than basketball or baseball. 
 <|endoftext|> 
User: When I was young I wanted to play in the NFL.  Being female I was a bit small - even though technically it would have been allowed!
Bot: There have been a few female kickers, but I don't think any have made it past college football. Hopefully some day
 <|endoftext|> 
User: Yes the kickers play the least of all - even though there is only 11 minutes of actual gameplay in a whole game!
Bot: That's why I can't sit and watch a whole game. I have to be doing something else at the same time. Too many breaks, and replays. I know a lot people like it, but it gets to be too much sometimes. 
 <|endoftext|> 
User: Yes.  But if you like technology you can learn a lot - they have tracking chips in the shoulder pads and the ball to study 
Bot: That would be interesting to look into! I may have to now. 
 <|endoftext|> 
User: Yes.  The game is so dangerous that even though they get paid a lot, an engineer will make more money over a career.
Bot: It is surely a short lived career. But many go into coaching of some sort after. 
 <|endoftext|> 
User: Yes.   My dog and I still enjoy watching the game.  She understands when I yell and point at the screen
Bot: Ha! That's cute. She must think people are stealing a toy. Which I guess they are.
 <|endoftext|> 
User: Yes,  My dog is loveable - she has even donated blood - she has a rarer type of the 12 different types dogs have.
Bot: Oh, thats really amazing. I didn't know dogs could donate blood. 
 <|endoftext|> 
User: Yes they can!  Other dogs need it after surgeries as well!  I like how Istanbul treats their animals  - it even has vending machine for stray dogs
Bot: There are some dog parks here in America that are starting to do it too. But I have heard many areas in Turkey treat stray cats and dogs wonderfully. They are part of their community. 
 <|endoftext|> 
User: Yes I love dogs and cats.  Google likes dogs better though - its even in their code of conduct!
Bot: I love almost all animals. They're pretty amazing. 
 <|endoftext|> 
User: Me too!  My cat gets a bit testy sometimes though.  Many people think that dogs are color blind but they are not - they just dont see as many colors as humans.
Bot: It would be hard to train them as service animals if they couldn't see any colors. 
 <|endoftext|> 
User: Hello do you like football?
Bot: I do, its actually one of my favorite sports, do you like it?
 <|endoftext|> 
User: I dont follow it much,  but I do watch it sometimes. 
Bot: Do you have a favorite team? mine is in the AFC division
 <|endoftext|> 
User: The 49ers,  but they havent been good in awhile. 
Bot: My favorite team is the Patriots and maybe this season the 49ers can make it to the Superbowl, 
 <|endoftext|> 
User: Yeah that would be cool lol George rr martin calls the Patriots the lannisters of football lol
Bot: Thats a funny reference lol but I guess it makes sense, they have dominated the league for a while now, great coach + great players + awesome QB 
 <|endoftext|> 
User: do you watch any tv shows?
Bot: I do, I like to watch the Simpsons, what about you?
 <|endoftext|> 
User: Yeah classic.  I love the simpsons. 
Bot: Funny how Homer had 188 jobs in the first 400 episodes, not a guy I would trust with the safety of a nuclear power plant
 <|endoftext|> 
User: Yeah lol did you know there is one episode that Bart is not seen or mentioned. 
Bot: I didnt know that, he is like the star of the show, doesnt make sense to have Simpsons without Bart.
 <|endoftext|> 
User: I know right!
Bot: What other shows do you like to watch?
 <|endoftext|> 
User: Game of thrones,  westworld,  handmaids tale,  homeland,  broklyn nine nine,  the flash,  supergirl,  walking dead,  santa clarita diet,  how I met your mother
Bot: Sounds like you follow a lot of tv shows lol, I like GOT and also The Flash, there are a lot of good series on TV now
 <|endoftext|> 
User: Yeah I watch a lot of tv.  Im still catching up on the flash I think I am on season 4 right now.  Yes I agree too much good tv.  In between shows I like to watch discovery channel shows lol 
Bot: Season 4 is one of the best ones, I like how Reverse flash is back on the show and Cicada is a formidable villain
 <|endoftext|> 
User: Would you be much of a football fan, or interested in the Eagles?
Bot: Yes, I am a football fan, like the Eagles and wished they have made it to the superbowl.
 <|endoftext|> 
User: I can't say that I am. I'm aware of the big stuff that goes on but not the details.  I certainly wouldn't get worked up about who the Eagles play first in a season.
Bot: I am not a Eagles fan either, I am a Steelers, but since the Steelers haven't made it, I turned to the eagles.
 <|endoftext|> 
User: I live near Cleveland, I know the Browns and Steelers are rivals.  I think the only team the Browns fans dislike more are the Ravens as they feel like they stole their team.
Bot: I have never care for the Ravens for some reason, so are you a Browns fan?
 <|endoftext|> 
User: I live here, so I guess by default I am.  I'm not born and raised so it's not life or death for me.  Is there anything harder in football than being a Browns fan?
Bot: Well, I would  say no, especially if you are a fan win or lose, because for some reason they seems not to be able to make it to a superbowl these days.
 <|endoftext|> 
User: Do you watch much football on television, Monday night football and all that?
Bot: No, I watched sunday's game also, my current home is Las Vegas and I pretty much live in the casino watching sports, I try to watch the majority of the games including college football.
 <|endoftext|> 
User: That sounds like a lot of work.  I think part of the reason I haven't got into football is the length of the game, I just don't have three hours.  I doesn't help that I was born in Britain.
Bot: Oh so do you have a favorite sport that you spend time watching on your days off from work or just for your relaxed and run time?
 <|endoftext|> 
User: I have a young family, all my free time seems to have vanished.  Back in the day is would have been soccer.  I barely see any TV anymore, the kids hog the remote now.
Bot: Hahaha, I understand, did you know the nfl uses tracking chips in their shoulder pads to record players movements on the field?
 <|endoftext|> 
User: Do you use that information when your in the casino to give you an edge?  How many games a week do you think you watch?
Bot: I only get weekends at the casino, I always get my weekends off from work, Now it just my wife and I, no, I don't used it.
 <|endoftext|> 
User: You don't have a dog by chance?  I have full house here, kids, dogs rabbits, and my wife has a horse.  Maybe I should buy myself a ticket to Las Vegas for some peace.
Bot: Yes at least for a vacation, the chips are also located in the football to track  velocity, rotation, ball speed and location.
 <|endoftext|> 
User: It's amazing the amount of information they collect in sports now.  When I read reports about soccer they tell  you how far the player has ran, sprinted, pass percentages and such. They have heat maps to to show where they've been on the field too.
Bot: I watched soccer also, I don't completely understand the entire rules and game, I do understand how the players score points.
 <|endoftext|> 
User: Hello, How are you? Do you like dogs?
Bot: I love dogs, you know who else likes dogs, google!
 <|endoftext|> 
User: Yes, I read that too! I didn't know that they had blood drives though, did you?
Bot: I didn't. That is helpful because I think dogs have 12 different blood types
 <|endoftext|> 
User: Yes, interesting. Its good to know dogs are not color blind! I wonder which colors they see most?
Bot: For sure! we were taught wrong growing up
 <|endoftext|> 
User: Yes, I thought it was black and white growing up.
Bot: I agree lol. Did you know dogs and elephants are the only animals that respond to pointing
 <|endoftext|> 
User: Yes, isn't that interesting as well. I wish we had those vending machines here in the US with food and water for dogs in exchange for plastic bottles. That's such a good idea!!
Bot: for sure, I would be donating left and right. I love dogs! Do you watch TV?
 <|endoftext|> 
User: Some, not as much as I use to. When I have time, I'm on the internet, where I can look up shows I like. I do have cable but I rarely use it.
Bot: yea me too. I was a fan of pokemon back in the  day. they have 750 episodes
 <|endoftext|> 
User: Yes, it was always on it seems. Do you remember Thomas the tank engine?
Bot: I used to love that show, did you watch it?
 <|endoftext|> 
User: No, I wasn't sure what it was? Was it a children show?
Bot: Yes it was a book too. Thomas the train was like blue and gray. I think there were famous people who played his voice here and there
 <|endoftext|> 
User: Yes, Ringo Star was one of them. Do you watch football? The NFL's average live game play is only 11 minutes!
Bot: That is insane. that means like everything else is almost 3 hours. Talk about boring if you think about it! They need a woman to play 
 <|endoftext|> 
User: Yes, there is no rule against it! Good chat!!
Bot: You too, have a good night!
 <|endoftext|> 
User: What do you think about Malcolm Perry? Do you think he has a good future in the Navy?
Bot: I'm not sure who he is, is he a football player?
 <|endoftext|> 
User: Yes he is a quarterback for the Navy football team apparently. And he's really good I think
Bot: Better than Baker Mayfield was, during his U of OK days?
 <|endoftext|> 
User: Yes that's possible. At least he's better than Baker Mayfield was at Halo 3, and the baker was excellent at Halo 3 haha.
Bot: Yeah, he thought about becoming a pro gamer. I'm from Cleveland, so I'm glad he didn't follow through with that.
 <|endoftext|> 
User: Yep I agree with you. What do you think about Kelly-Moore by the way? He's the only quarterback in the NFL who is Left-Handed which is crazy
Bot: I think that's awesome. Of course, I would as I'm a lefty too. I still find it odd that ESPN won an Emmy for their superimposed yellow line. That is so weird.
 <|endoftext|> 
User: That is really weird. But it is a great invention. what do you think about the highest scoring football game of all time by the way
Bot: I don't know anything about it, was it Georgia Tech? My brother goes there.
 <|endoftext|> 
User: Yes Georgia Tech won, they beat Cumberland 222 to 0, definitely a blowout!
Bot: That's insane! I wonder why the coaches didn't stop it? Then again, the U of IA has a locker room painted pink for their visiting team.
 <|endoftext|> 
User: Yes I wonder how that turned out for them. Do you think they won more games after it was painted pink? I want to see the stats on that
Bot: I would like to see those too. These days, pink is considered ambiance, lol. In the 60's pro bowlers made more than football players. That's unreal.
 <|endoftext|> 
User: That is crazy, definitely it's the opposite case today. Do you ever watch basketball by the way? I know that Kareem Abdul-Jabbar was super awesome back in the day
Bot: I watch the Cavs, lol. I find it funny that there is a court in the Supreme Court building, and they actually call it "The Highest Court in the Land".
 <|endoftext|> 
User: That is really funny. You think they ever play up there? It's funny because it's on the top floor too
Bot: I wonder that myself. I bet some of them do. What do you think of the New Zealand basket ball team?
 <|endoftext|> 
User: Well I think their nickname is not a good one for the United States lol they call themselves the "All Blacks"
Bot: Nope, that isn't racist at all. what are some of these people thinking? I find it odd that the man who invented basketball is the only losing coach in the U of KS history.
 <|endoftext|> 
User: The Navy's player Malcolm Perry is looking good! He cant stop moving those feet of his.
Bot: Right? He definitely seems ready for the new season to show what he's got
 <|endoftext|> 
User: Yeah, I love watching the Navy football team and think their QB Perry is the best up and coming player because of his speed. Hecan zip around and beat guys that way.
Bot: I agree. Also think he's ready to show he can throw this year too. He's been working on his passes and has a good arm!
 <|endoftext|> 
User: Yeah, I agree. He can throw bullets with great accuracy too. Perry has the Southern Methodist game haunting him and has something to prove now.
Bot: I don't blame him. He rushed 282 yards which was a record but his only pass was intercepted. Definitely impacted his confidence in what he could do and his abilities. 
 <|endoftext|> 
User: You make a really good point that I forgot to credit him. The offensive coordinator Ivan Jasper has been working with Perry on throwing and new reps.
Bot: They feel really confident about Perry's skills as a thrower. Though it's been a few years since Perry focused on passing, he was a quarterback in high school. 
 <|endoftext|> 
User: Yeah, I agree with you. Coach Jasper has also been working with Perry on rapid-fire passing drills and throwing one-on-one with him since spring practice. That is promising and super cool too.
Bot: I agree. I think Jasper is in a better more focused place to work with Perry too. He's been more focused and in a better place to be able to work with Perry since his son's heart transplant surgery.
 <|endoftext|> 
User: I can't even imagine going through something so scary and serious with any of my kids. Perry has a good handle of his career and his personal life and knows how to focus on what's important and be in the moment. Alex Smith is another amazing QB.
Bot: Perry seems more mature and comfortable in the football world too. It seems like he understands things better and is in a position to answer questions and talk in football speak. 
 <|endoftext|> 
User: Yeah, he might be the next Alex Smith or Baker Mayfield? Who knows because both of those quarterbacks are very accomplished. Alex Smith went to college early. He took so many classes in high school that he went super early.
Bot: Really? That's impressive. I did not know that about Alex Smith. Random fact though, did you know there's only one left handed quarterback in the NFL? 
 <|endoftext|> 
User: Noway, I have never really thought about it but that is very rare. Yeah Alex Smith was actually getting his bachelors within the first two years of college. He is a very smart guy on and off the field.
Bot: Wow that's really cool. Sounds a lot like that senior Abey. Started 9 games last year for a 7-6 team. 
 <|endoftext|> 
User: Man, thats crazy,really? I went to Kansas and James Naismith was the inventor of the basketball, that's the closest I have been to a famous college story.
Bot: Well that's super cool! Another random fact which surprised me the other day, only 2 African American quarterbacks have won the Super Bowl. 
 <|endoftext|> 
User: Noway, that doesn't seem right but it is a fact for sure. The highest paid state employees are coaches now thats not surprising.
Bot: I did not know that about coaches though I guess it makes sense. I do know that the american flags at football stadiums weigh 1,100 pounds and cost $50,000 to make which seems like a lot of money. 
 <|endoftext|> 
User: That is really incredible. A lot of money flows through sports and keeps players engaged. Baker Mayfield almost became a professional gamer instead of QB. It was a good thing that he wised up for all our sakes. The money is in football.
Bot: Or in basketball movies like Space Jam. Which is the highest grossing basketball movie of all time.

User: How's it going, did you know Tom Brady's jv team never started him despite not winning a game?
Bot: That's incredible. I guess that's why the coach is a JV coach.
 <|endoftext|> 
User: He was a pretty awful JV coach if he couldn't even get his team to score a touchdown
Bot: did you know football can mean different sports depending on what region you are in?
 <|endoftext|> 
User: Yea, it can be called soccer or rugby in certain places
Bot: Also Australian rules and Gaelic. Did you know that in 39 of 50 states, the highest paid public employee are either college football or basketball coaches?
 <|endoftext|> 
User: No, that's a shame states waste that much money on football/basketball coaches
Bot: I mean, the Supreme Court has a basketball court on its top floor. Sports are a part of our lives now
 <|endoftext|> 
User: That's pretty funny theres a court at the supreme court considering most of the judges are very old
Bot: Who are some of your favorite quarterbacks in the NFL?
 <|endoftext|> 
User: Alex Smith is pretty cool, he was able to start college as a junior
Bot: I heard about that. And he still ended up being the first overall pick in the NFL draft.
 <|endoftext|> 
User: I wonder if Alex Smith was able to finish his Masters degree after he was drafted
Bot: Probably. Baker Mayfield definitely didn't get his Masters after getting drafted. I heard he's a hardcore gamer
 <|endoftext|> 
User: Yea, he's a good qb but doesn't seem too smart if he seriously consider playing video games professionally 
Bot: Gaming is very popular nowadays though. If you can make money off of it, hats off to you.
 <|endoftext|> 
User: Yea but he could always do that after retirement instead of broadcasting like Kellan Moore does now after being the only left handed qb in the nfl
Bot: I feel bad for those college players that don't have a shot at the NFL. There's a QB at Navy that didn't attempt a pass for his final three starts
 <|endoftext|> 
User: That's a shame, who was he?
Bot: His name's Malcolm Perry. He's a Junior. You gotta be tough to start at QB for Navy
 <|endoftext|> 
User: Hi!  Are you a fan of sports?
Bot: I love watching football and basketball,  but not so much Tom Brady.  I find it funny his high school team never even allowed him to play.
 <|endoftext|> 
User: Lol. I think most of America agrees with you.  He has more super bowl wins than most teams.
Bot: For sure.     I always found it curious that the whole point of the huddle was to help a deaf quarterback communicate without the opposing team seeing his signals.
 <|endoftext|> 
User: I know, how cool to have something you did to help you out stick and be a big part of the game.  Maybe if that team who lost by 222 points used it they might have done better.
Bot: No doubt!    Or they could have used Alex Jones - he was smart enough he took so many ap tests in high school that he started college as a junior and then became the number one draft pick!
 <|endoftext|> 
User: That is certainly a lot of classes, he even worked to a masters degree while staying to play.
Bot: Yes.  He is amazing.   Its funny - in baseball being left-handed can be an asset, but there is only one left-handed quarterback in the NFL.
 <|endoftext|> 
User: That is certainly surprising, I wonder why more left handed people don't play the position?
Bot: I don't know.  Maybe they prefer bowling?  Bowlers used to make twice as much as football players.
 <|endoftext|> 
User: It seems like doing anything in sports will get you some notoriety, like ESPN winning an Emmy for the yellow line. Clearly I chose the wrong line of work
Bot: For sure.  You could take up basketball - even the Supreme Court likes to play.
 <|endoftext|> 
User: Yup.  Highest court in the land :)  It is odd though, that the inventor of the sport went on to be the only losing coach at the U of Kansas.
Bot: That is pretty crazy.  I think I want to be a coach though - in 39 states a coach is the highest paid state employee.
 <|endoftext|> 
User: There definitely is a lot of money in sports, even if you arent like Green-Ellis and never have a fumble.
Bot: Yeah that is pretty insane.  Or you could be like Kareem Adbul-Jabbar who was so good at dunking that he got the shot banned.
 <|endoftext|> 
User: Some people getting so good they are ruining it for the rest of us. ha ha 
Bot: I am only 5'1 so dunking has never been my forte, even though there has been some good short players.  
 <|endoftext|> 
User: Im not much taller, only 5'6", jumping really hasnt been my strong suit.  So a career in basketball was never in my cards, seeing as I am not a strong free thrower, even if it is granny style.
Bot: Granny style is the actual most consistent way to shoot but no one ever wants to do that.  The hoop is 10 feet high so that's almost twice my height.  Much easier for the 7 footers
 <|endoftext|> 
User: Well, I must get going, it has been nice chatting today
Bot: Don't hit new zealand - you won't be tall enough for their team!
 <|endoftext|> 
User: Do you like the NFL?
Bot: I am. I'm a big fan of sports and sports trivia, in general.
 <|endoftext|> 
User: Great, sounds like we will get along, I am a fan of sports as well, do you have a favorite team?
Bot: Definitely not the Saints. They have a pretty sexist policy I'm not a fan of regarding the cheerleaders and players.
 <|endoftext|> 
User: That rule is so unfair, makes me angry, its really humiliating
Bot: Yeah, can you believe they can't even eat in the same restaurant? Not only that, but if a player comes into the restaurant while a cheerleader is already mid-meal, the cheerleader has to leave.
 <|endoftext|> 
User: Terrible rule, I would be so angry and feel so bad if I had to leave, specially if im with friends and family, humiliating and really unfair,
Bot: Oddly enough, though, did you know the league itself has no written rule saying women can't play?
 <|endoftext|> 
User: I don't think that will ever happen, watching a woman play in the NFL
Bot: Apparently, as long as they meet the league's eligibility requirements, they can play.
 <|endoftext|> 
User: I bet woman could be as capable as men in the game if they had the same strength
Bot: Sounds like the increase of females in engineering will be worth it over a career in football, anyhow, as the average lifetime earnings of an engineer is higher than that of a football player.
 <|endoftext|> 
User: Oh I see, and I do agree sexism can be another issue, amazing how much money engineers make
Bot: It's pretty crazy how much football players make though, considering the average game only has an average of 11 minutes of actual gameplay.
 <|endoftext|> 
User: Only 11 minutes? what a scam, the game lasts 60 minutes and only 11 minutes accounts to less than a quarter,
Bot: A televised game lasts even longer than an hour, in my experience. I suppose we could use the tracking chips in the players' pads and the balls to find out how they really spend most of their time.
 <|endoftext|> 
User: That is a great idea, that way we can tell the distance they actually run, the calories and many different stats about the game, cool facts and stats
Bot: More specifically, they use the tracking devices to track velocity, rotation, ball speed, and location.
 <|endoftext|> 
User: Do you like basketball as well?
Bot: I like it less than football, but I think it's funny that the US Supreme Court building has a basketball court on top of the building called "the highest court in the land".
 <|endoftext|> 
User: Hey! Eli Manning just had a birthday earlier this month. He turned 38 and my guess is, has more cash than everyone I know will ever see. (!)
Bot: I know! And he was not even the best manning!
 <|endoftext|> 
User: I self-identify as a fat woman when in reality I'm 100 lbs soaking wet - - - Chili, beer, wings, nachos, and some spinach dip are what I'm doing this Sunday for the Super Bowl. Definitely not healthy but, tastey so I'm down for that! 
Bot: Damn! That sounds great! Im going to make sume jubalaya. I may add some wings now. Although it is supposed to be -40 this week so I may not be able to grill...
 <|endoftext|> 
User: That's tragic. I wonder if Eli Manning's name is spelled Elisha rather than Elijah or if that is a typo. For a man who has a genuis level IQ I'd suspect he'd be po'ed at his parents for such an unusual spelling of that name
Bot: When you have 2 super bowl rings and your dad has none, you can be a little mean to him...
 <|endoftext|> 
User: I suppose so. "We're winners, and we can do what we want." Wait. That was NASCAR and Talladega Nights, not NFL. I find it hysterical someone was quoted as saying, "Competitors last in this league" speaking of The NFL. I thought NFL stood for "Not For Long." ? 
Bot: Maybe he can paint his room pink like the University of Iowa painted their visitor's locker room.
 <|endoftext|> 
User: lol lol lol How much do pro bowlers make today? If they made more in the 60's than pro football players surely it's more than I'm making now.  I'm more into being lazy and I need/want a new job. Maybe I can take up bowling... 
Bot: Have you ever seen King Pin with Woody Harrelson. Everytime I see bowling on TV, I think to myself "I'm in awe to be around so many great athletes..." and giggle...
 <|endoftext|> 
User: Gosh yes - I forgot all about that flick. Should rewatch that. 
Bot: Maybe you could be a movie critic as your new gig! Just watch netflix all day!
 <|endoftext|> 
User: I'm not flamboyant enough to be a movie critic but bowling and drinking beer is something I would certainly give an honest effort haha.
Bot: That's the spirit! I wouldn't be sober enough to practice or compete. Drinking beer at the bowling alley is almost pavlovian...
 <|endoftext|> 
User: If Uncle Buck could do it, so could you and I! One rule: No toothpicks allowed haha
Bot: HA! It's like playing darts... you just have a beer while doing it...
 <|endoftext|> 
User: Did you see the youtube vid where the guy who built the exploding glitter bomb package had also built a dartboard that moves for a bullseye every time? I would need one of those to be successful in darts. Otherwise everyone nearby would need a helmet and pads lol
Bot: HA! I did see the exploding glitter bomb. If he sold it on amazon, he could make a killing. People, like me, are so vindictive!
 <|endoftext|> 
User: I am as well. I use the heck out of Amazon Prime Now and Instacart. I can't even tell you the last time I was even in an actual grocery store or mall... And would be as mad as a baptized cat if someone swiped my stuff off my porch. 
Bot: I know. I am glad I live in the woods with security cameras! Nice chatting with you!
 <|endoftext|> 
User: Hi there, would you happen to be a football fan?
Bot: I'm a big NFL fan!
 <|endoftext|> 
User: Cool! Are you a fan of Eli Manning?
Bot: I am.  I hope he keeps playing.  His first name is Elisha.  Different name I've never heard before.
 <|endoftext|> 
User: I had no idea! Crazy to think Peyton and their father were all good (for a time..) QBs
Bot: Yes!  I remember when their dad Archie played because I was a kid then and he was a QB during those years.  Eli has a genius level IQ.
 <|endoftext|> 
User: I wonder what it takes to be a genuis lol
Bot: I wish I knew the secret.  lol  Eli played college at the University of Mississippi and was originally drafted by the San Diego Chargers who immediately traded him to the NY Giants.
 <|endoftext|> 
User: Yea, I don't think he wanted to play there. I see the NFL has no rule against female players.
Bot: Interesting!  Wonder if one will ever play.  Maybe a kicker?  The Saints have an odd rule that prevents females from eating at a restaurant at the same time as an NFL player.  Odd rule.
 <|endoftext|> 
User: I could see a woman kicker player in the NFL. an average game has only 11 minutes of live gameplay.
Bot: Crazy when you think that the games stretch out to over 3 hours.  lol  The average lifetime earnings of an engineer is higher than that the earnings of an average NFL or MLB player.
 <|endoftext|> 
User: Yea, shorter careers for sure. I believe they offer financial counseling too
Bot: Interesting.  They need it. I read somewhere that NFL players are broke too years after retiring from the game.  Did you know they put tracking chips in the shoulder pads and footballs to record data?
 <|endoftext|> 
User: I figured they had to know about speed and velocity somehow. I wonder if they are really small?
Bot: They would have to be I would think?  Do you know what the highest scoring football game ever was?
 <|endoftext|> 
User: I don't know - from before the super bowl era?
Bot: Oh yeah...in 1916.  lol  Georgia Tech beat Cumberland 222-0!
 <|endoftext|> 
User: Well, I could call that a blowout...
Bot: Defintately!  lol  In the 1960's top bowlers made twice as much as top football stars during that time.  Times have sure changed since then.
 <|endoftext|> 
User: I do not appreciate the Redskins  effort against the Giants . It got worse 
Bot: Which teams do you expect to win the Superbowl?
 <|endoftext|> 
User: I think any team could win that since it is a game of the champions 
Bot: The Redskins certainly will not win, it seems.
 <|endoftext|> 
User: No they will not. They know that themselves. That is the result of their self-critiques in the visitors locker room at Metlife stadium 
Bot: Will the Giants make it?
 <|endoftext|> 
User: Of course, everyone knows that, Giant has always been a team with good forward and they sliced on redskin defense 
Bot: The NFL actually has 32 teams/ Each year some of them are not competitive, though.
 <|endoftext|> 
User: Yes and the Giants had always seem to stand out in them. They have most of their rushing total in Dec. 21, 2008. When they won Carolina 
Bot: Apparently the University of Iowa features pink locker rooms.
 <|endoftext|> 
User: I am not sure what you mean by that. But i will like to chip in this fact that football recorded the highest  score ever in 1916 
Bot: That's so long ago. Apparently this game featured Georgia Tech.
 <|endoftext|> 
User: Of course yes, it ended in a 222-0. Wow that is so huge 
Bot: I have never seen such a blowout. BenJarvus Green-Ellis has never fumbled.
 <|endoftext|> 
User: Yes, i learnt that but i don't know if he make that much because it is a known fact that the top player from 1960 made twice as much as top football stars 
Bot: ESPN came out with the yellow line on the televised field.
 <|endoftext|> 
User: That is cool, it helped a lot. Do you know of a New York Giants player called Eli. The short form for Elisha 
Bot: Bowlers used to get paid more than football stars.
 <|endoftext|> 
User: Yes, i know that but do you pay attention to Eli, He was the overall pick for 2004 NFL Draft
Bot: He has been a decent NFL QB, born in 1981.
 <|endoftext|> 
User: I have a cousin that was his great fan because of his genius level IQ 
Bot: His full name is Elisha.
 <|endoftext|> 
User: Do you follow the NFL?  What do you think about their loss to the Giants?
Bot: I do watch the NFL. The NFC east is really competitive. It could have gone either way...
 <|endoftext|> 
User: That's too bad.  Do you know there is no rule against female players.
Bot: I did not. I think it would be scary to watch women play against some of the larger football players.
 <|endoftext|> 
User: Surprisingly, though New Orleans Saints cheerleaders have to leave a diner if they see another NFL player in the restaurant.  Unfair standards.
Bot: Seems sexist. Maybe that's why they lost 2 weeks ago on a bad call... karma!
 <|endoftext|> 
User: I'm glad for the yellow line though from ESPN.  It helps a lot on calls in football. They won an award Emmy for it.
Bot: When it first came out, I told my wife that people had to move it and that players have tripped on it. Im a bad person...
 <|endoftext|> 
User: I wish I was at the game where 222 points was scored in football back in 1916.  That would have been a trip at Georgia tech.
Bot: You gotta pull the QB at 60-0, right? Speaking of emasculating, Iowa paints their visiting locker room pink.
 <|endoftext|> 
User: Sounds like another intimidation factor.  Bowlers made more than top football stars in the 60's.  That's crazy!
Bot: That's odd! They don't make more than Elisha Manning!
 <|endoftext|> 
User: How much does Elisha make? 
Bot: Millions! He's the QB for the NY Giants football team.
 <|endoftext|> 
User: His brother also plays and his dad played.
Bot: I feel bad for his older brother Cooper. He never played. Seems like he's the odd man out.
 <|endoftext|> 
User: Eli Manning and Peyton both were number one drafts 
Bot: Yes they were. I wonder where Archie was drafted?
 <|endoftext|> 
User: I'm not sure, but Manning played for University of Mississippi 2000 to 2003 and was first pick for San Diego but immediately traded to the Giants.  Lucky for the Giants.
Bot: Nice chatting with you!
 <|endoftext|> 
User: Hey there my friend you ever watch football on television?
Bot: I do not follow football but I do watch it occassionally. 
 <|endoftext|> 
User: I watch the Super Bowl. I don't normally watch a lot of sports though. Do you like the Patriots? They have a player that has never fumbled the ball before. His name is Benjarvus Green-Ellis
Bot: No I do not like the Patriots.  I think that is a former player though,  Yes that is impressive,  I wonder why this guy isnt more known 
 <|endoftext|> 
User: Yes I agree with you. Like I said I don't really watch sports so I'm not sure if he's a current player or not haha. What I do know is that ESPN won an Emmy. They created that yellow line that shows the first downs on football games
Bot: good for them!  I hear the highest score in football was 222-0!  That is crazy!
 <|endoftext|> 
User: I know right! I can't believe that Georgia Tech was that much better. I would have left the stands once it got to 100 to 0 LOL
Bot: I know right,  lol me too!
 <|endoftext|> 
User: What are your thoughts on Eli Manning? I know that he was super dominant back when he played.
Bot: I know Eli is short for Elisha. 
 <|endoftext|> 
User: That is really weird. Also I didn't know he was born in 1981. I've never heard the name Elicia before. also apparently he has a genius-level IQ
Bot: Thats amazing!  Is he related to Taryn Manning?  Shes from orange is the new black.
 <|endoftext|> 
User: Oh I didn't know that. I've never seen that show so I have no idea. I guess he is the son of NFL quarterback Archie Manning in the younger brother of NFL quarterback Peyton Manning. It's definitely in their blood to be good quarterbacks haha
Bot: I dont know if he is related to her,  I was just asking. Yeah thats interesting.  I guess they just have that natural talent. 
 <|endoftext|> 
User: Did you know that the NFL uses tracking chips in the shoulder pads? They can track the location and position of all the players as well as the ball
Bot: Thats that is really cool,  they also put it in the football.
 <|endoftext|> 
User: Yep you're right. They can tell the ball speed ,location, rotation and velocity, I just hope that they stopped the tracking after the players leave the field haha that would be super awkward
Bot: Its in their shoulder pads,  so I guess it depends where they take those lol 
 <|endoftext|> 
User: Haha yep well as long as they don't take anywhere those home LOL. What do you think of the fact that the NFL game on average only has about 11 minutes of gameplay, that seems solo to me
Bot: yeah that crazy, too many time outs, breaks,  commercials
 <|endoftext|> 
User: Hi, how are you?
Bot: Hello Im great Im happy because my favorite team won the Superbowl on the weekend! so happy indeed.
 <|endoftext|> 
User: You're a Pats fan???? Congrats on the win!
Bot: I am a Patriots fan and thanks a lot, what team do you like, AFC or NFC?
 <|endoftext|> 
User: I like the Bears so NFC north. I was rooting for the Pats though. What did you do to celebrate?
Bot: How did the Bears do this season? do you know if they are getting new players this season and I was with friends and family I drank a lot of beer and got wasted lol
 <|endoftext|> 
User: They made the playoffs but lost on a missed kick to Philly. We're not getting anyone. We're ok and will add a few pieces. At least our locker room isn't pink..
Bot: Its better to mantain a solid base, sounds like you were close and yeah I wonder what is the effect of those pink locker rooms on visiting teams
 <|endoftext|> 
User: Not as bad as a 222-0 whoopin' georgia tech put on cumberland.
Bot: That must be the most humilliating loss in football history, I would have retire from football after that game if you lose by more than 200 points and didnt score then something is seriously wrong.
 <|endoftext|> 
User: I think it should be forced retirement if you lose by more than 200. You should never wear a uniform again. As I was writing that, I thought, where is cumberland anyways???? So they may have been forced into retirement...
Bot: I dont think they have a football team anymore lol, they were in need of a player like Benjarvus Green Ellis.
 <|endoftext|> 
User: Or maybe they didn't have the yellow line and didn't know where the first down was?
Bot: Could be, I guess we have ESPN to thank for that now, it was a great contribution although not sure if it deserved an emmy.
 <|endoftext|> 
User: An emmy is pretty far. But can you imagine watching without it now?
Bot: Yeah I agree, it did change things for football, do you know who Eli Manning is?
 <|endoftext|> 
User: I do. He's Payton's little brother right? What's he do for a living?
Bot: He is the quarterback of the Giants, I guess football runs in the family
 <|endoftext|> 
User: I would say so! Isn't his dad a famous football player too?
Bot: Yup he played for around 13 seasons and was a pretty good player as well, Elis first name is actually Elisha, I think someone wanted a girl lol
 <|endoftext|> 
User: I would say so. I think Eli was a good choice but it is hard to pick on an Elisha when he can throw a ball through your chest.
Bot: I agree lol, probably wouldnt want to mess with him, you know Eli actually has a high iq like at a genius level.
 <|endoftext|> 
User: Do you follow the NFL?
Bot: I don't really watch it much, how about you?
 <|endoftext|> 
User: I do, I love the sport, so the NFL has 2 divisions NFC and AFC
Bot: Interesting, so the National football conference and the American football conference. And they play against each other it seems.
 <|endoftext|> 
User: Well 16 teams in each division, the play against each other and then they face the champion of the other conference in the Super bowl so its AFC vs NFC in the end.
Bot: That sounds pretty interesting! Apparently the NFL has no written rules about females joining. 
 <|endoftext|> 
User: Really? so females could also play? that is a bit unusual I don't think I have the stomach to watch that.
Bot: Yeah, but they would have to be pretty strong to meet the requirements I imagine. I wonder if there have been any females in the NFL?
 <|endoftext|> 
User: I don't think so I haven't seen one at least. Interesting how players have tracking chips in their shoulders
Bot: Yeah, that is a bit strange. Also very interesting how there's only actually 11 minutes of game play!
 <|endoftext|> 
User: only 11 minutes woah, thats not much at all, games last 2-3 hours, 
Bot: Yeah, there is so much that goes into it with such little actual game play. New Orleans saints cheerleaders and players are not allowed to dine together. Very strange.
 <|endoftext|> 
User: That is strange, I don't like that rule I hear that cheerleaders have to leave if a player arrives at a restaurant so unfair.
Bot: Yeah, I wonder why it was made up or if it's even enforced. The university of Iowas visiting locker room is painted pink!
 <|endoftext|> 
User: That's funny, that would confuse a team or two lol, being all pumped up in a pink locker room that is funny. 
Bot: I think I read once that pink it a calming color, they use it in some jails too. The highest score in a football game was 222-0. Ouch.
 <|endoftext|> 
User: 222-0 woah!! that is a humiliating defeat, the other team was blind or thought they were scoring in the wrong direction.
Bot: Yeah, I can't imagine what was going on to lose that bad! The top bowlers in the 1960s made more than the top football stars. Times have definitely changed.
 <|endoftext|> 
User: They made more money really? I guess that score makes more sense now, did you hear about the Emmy ESPN won back in the day?
Bot: I haven't heard about that, how did they manage that?
 <|endoftext|> 
User: They won the Emmy because of the creation of the yellow first down line, anyway its been great chatting with you. 
Bot: Interesting! Nice chatting with you too!
 <|endoftext|> 
User: Good morning! How are you today?
Bot: hi how are you? I'm good
 <|endoftext|> 
User: I'm doing well! Are you a fan of football at all?
Bot: I sometimes watch. i try to watch the super bowl.
 <|endoftext|> 
User: This year it was so boring! It was even more boring to know that only 11 minutes of live gameplay happened in it haha.
Bot: I think the game was better the previous year. a big comeback at the end. 11 minutes? yeah, it seems too short. but there is so much violence, people love it.
 <|endoftext|> 
User: Oh I agree! I bet it was a better game than in 1916 where Cumberland lost to Georgia Tech 222-0 lol.
Bot: I wonder what the coach was thinking there. I think that a game like that is shameful. what is the point?
 <|endoftext|> 
User: I feel like the team just gave up from the beginning. Maybe they had a pink locker room like the Iowa Hawkeye's visitor locker room is.
Bot: that pink locker room stunt! does that work at all? does u of Iowa win a lot at home? i doubt it.
 <|endoftext|> 
User: I don't think it works. I'm a Hawkeye fan and they seem to win more on the road haha.
Bot: if it worked, other teams would do the same thing. still, it is a fun fact.
 <|endoftext|> 
User: Well said! Can you believe the Green Bay Packers have been around since 1919?
Bot: Yes, i can. that is a strange name though. what exactly do they pack?
 <|endoftext|> 
User: I'm not sure! I know they were started based off the name of Indian Packing Company!
Bot: Oh, that makes sense. were they a meat packing company? did they own the team? i think the team is owned by the city now.
 <|endoftext|> 
User: I know they paid for the Packers first uniforms if they named the team after them. Good move on their part since they've sold out every game since 1960!
Bot: yeah, i wonder how much it would cost to buy tix from someone. the secondary market must be expensive.
 <|endoftext|> 
User: I agree! I wish I would have been at the game where they first lost to the Beloit Fairies. That is a unique name for a football team!
Bot: What a name. How would you like play for that team? "Hello, im a fairy. No seriously, I am!" Anyway, great chat!
 <|endoftext|> 
User: do you like football?
Bot: I sure do. Snoop Dogg once wrote a song for his son's team
 <|endoftext|> 
User: WOw. U of Iowa painted the visitor locker room pink
Bot: WOw I wonder if that is supposed to have some impact on the players
 <|endoftext|> 
User: I wonder too. Bowlers made more than football players in the 60s
Bot: Yeah I guess it was a more popular sport back in the day
 <|endoftext|> 
User: True. Do you know the highest score in college football?
Bot: Yes it was 222-0 and that was in 1916, do you know who was playing?
 <|endoftext|> 
User: Yes it was Georgia Tech that made history with that win against Cumberland
Bot: Yeah. Did you know that more than half of the largest football stadiums are in the US?
 <|endoftext|> 
User: Really that is amazing. ESPN won an Emmy for the superimposed yellow line
Bot: Yeah. Did you hear NFL is using tracking chips on the players now?
 <|endoftext|> 
User: WOw cool. Did you know that women can play in the NFL?
Bot: Nice. THe tracking chips are being used to collect information like velocity and rotation and such
 <|endoftext|> 
User: Nice, I wonder if they can use that to make the game safer
Bot: Good point. Did you know Matt Patricia used to be a rocket scientist
 <|endoftext|> 
User: Wow that is such a huge career jump, amazing
Bot: I know. Do you know when the first NFL playoff game was played?
 <|endoftext|> 
User: I actually do not know that, when was it?
Bot: It was back in 1932, very long ago. Nice chat
 <|endoftext|> 
User: How much do you know about american football?
Bot: nothing at all!
 <|endoftext|> 
User: Do you know that the NFL is the american football league?
Bot: I do know that. The national football league, right?
 <|endoftext|> 
User: Yes, I was suprised to learn that they actually have no written rule about not allowing female players. If they met the requirements of the league, women would be able to play. Also did you know that an average game only shows 11 minutes of live gameplay?
Bot: I just read that! And don't the games last for 2 hours usually? What are they doing in the mean time?
 <|endoftext|> 
User: There is a lot of commentary, breaks in between, positioning themselves, and etc. It is those few minutes the ball is thrown that makes or breaks the game.
Bot: Thats crazy that it all takes so long. Nfl uses tracking chips embedded in players shoulder pads to record a players every move on the field. they are also located inside footballs to track: velocity, rotation, ball speed and location.Do you like football?
 <|endoftext|> 
User: While I am not as passionate about it as some, I do have a passing interest. At the end of the day, they are collecting data to make better decisions to win the nfl.
Bot: Do you watch the 
 <|endoftext|> 
User: What do I watch?
Bot: Hit the wrong key! Do you watch the Green Bay Packers?
 <|endoftext|> 
User: I recently read that they are the only community owned major franchise in american professional sports, having a sold out game since 1960 and involving the community as a whole.
Bot: Thats awesome! The green bay packers are named after the indian packing company, who paid for their first uniforms on the condition the team be named after them.
 <|endoftext|> 
User: Wow how long a way they have come from barely having their uniforms to being a nationally recognized football team.
Bot: The green bay packers have sold out every game since 1960 too!
 <|endoftext|> 
User: Indeed, they have an impressive history as the 3rd oldest franchise in the NFL.
Bot: I wonder why the new orleans saints wont let their cheerleaders eat in the same resturant as the players?
 <|endoftext|> 
User: I also wonder if there is a story behind it. What do you think may be the reason?
Bot: Maybe they tend to get the crowd worked up? the NFL has 32 teams that play!
 <|endoftext|> 
User: Perhaps. This was a nice discussion. After we finish, I am curious to look up why.
Bot: Me too! Nice to talk to you today!
 <|endoftext|> 
User: Hello! 
Bot: Hello, happy new years!
 <|endoftext|> 
User: Happy New Years! Do you like football? Did you know Aaron Jones carried the ball 17 times for 107 yards!
Bot: Yes, I really like soccer. What a good move this man made
 <|endoftext|> 
User: Definitely! The Green Bay Packers are a very good team. 
Bot: Is that your favorite team?
 <|endoftext|> 
User: Yes, they are a great team I think. I have others but they are doing so good.
Bot: Well, I have many favorites, in fact I enjoy more to see the best ones than to rival them
 <|endoftext|> 
User: Yes! Very true although Prime pick success rate: 5-7 Green Bay Packers (-1) at Detroit Lions Pick: 
Bot: Sports commonly called football in certain places include association football (known as soccer in some countries); gridiron football (specifically American football or Canadian football); Australian rules football; rugby football (either rugby league or rugby union); and Gaelic football. These different variations of football are known as football codes.
 <|endoftext|> 
User: Cool! Very interesting! It's crazy that the NFL consists of 32 teams! That's a lot. Football is amazing
Bot: Yes, too much. Hey, what do you think about field football?
 <|endoftext|> 
User: I like it! I like all sports really. I think which type of football you like depends on the area you live in. I like them all.
Bot: Well, maybe it's in the area. I am more fond of this type of football in general, but I also enjoy other
 <|endoftext|> 
User: Did you know the highest score of a football game was 222-0 that's crazy! Back in 1916. 
Bot: Wow, that team was very mediocre. They would be playing with cones, hahahaha
 <|endoftext|> 
User: HAHAHA, That's true! I think it's funny that University of Iowa painted the locker room pink for the visiting teams, so funny!
Bot: Hahahaha yeah. They like to make them big rivals to provoke. Although everything is part of the show
 <|endoftext|> 
User: Very true! It's very interesting to know that Bowlers....made twice as much money as football stars in the 60's...weird!
Bot: Hey, what do you think about what the famous David Beckan did in our country with the stadium I think?
 <|endoftext|> 
User: I don't know too much about that. but we need to keep watching football for sure! It has been great chatting! Have a great day!
Bot: You have a good day
 <|endoftext|> 
User: Hello
Bot: Good morning.  Football huh?  Was interesting to see that Women could be in the league if they met league eligibility.
 <|endoftext|> 
User: Yeah, me too.An average nfl game only has 11 minutes of live gameplay
Bot: I would be curious to actually time that during some game.  I wonder why they chose to put chips in the shoulder pads?  They must be pretty strong to withstand the force on the field!
 <|endoftext|> 
User: Yeah, I was blow away by that. New orleans saints cheerleaders are forbidden from eating in the same restaurant as any nfl player and if they are already dining at a restaurant and an nfl player comes in after, the cheerleaders are required to leave.
Bot: Seems to me a little sexist.  I wonder why only that team and not any of the others like the Packers.  I wonder if being community owned any money made by the team goes back to the community in some fashion or back into the team?
 <|endoftext|> 
User: Hmmmm. The green bay packers are named after the indian packing company, who paid for their first uniforms on the condition the team be named after them.
Bot: Yes and beat by fairies..appropriate ;) .  Some things about this sport are interesting.  I couldn't imagine having gone to the Georgia Tech game.  A 222-0 score??  Did the other team even show up?
 <|endoftext|> 
User: That's absolutely crazy.  What a boring game to attend?????  The university of iowa's locker room for visiting football teams is completely painted pink
Bot: Guess they think that is going to psych out the opponent.  I would think that would trigger them to play harder. Guess there are just some teams that don't feel the need for gimmicks to win or draw in fans.  If the Packers have been able to sell out ever game since 1960 and have a wait list for tickets 30 years out??  Wow.
 <|endoftext|> 
User: Not a fan of Rodgers but the green bay packers are the only community owned, not for profit major franchise in american professional sports
Bot: I live in Minnesota so definitely not a fan of the Pack.  I am more player fan anyway.  I love Odell from the Giants. Guess he isn't going to be going anywhere but Eli might be looking for a new team.
 <|endoftext|> 
User: I'm a die hard Cowboys fan.  I can't wait for this weekend.
Bot: Who are they playing?  America's team...wonder who gave them that name?  Guess if I had to pick a team it would be Da Bears and Khalil Mack.  Big on Defensive. Think it is what really wins the games.
 <|endoftext|> 
User: Cowboys have the Seahawks at home.  Not sure what to expect from them.  Dallas defense is for real though.  Lawrence and the LBs are something else.
Bot: Seahawks are going to be touch at home.  They claim their stadium has one of the best home filed advantages.  out of 139 games to win 99 of them, they might be right.
 <|endoftext|> 
User: Yes, they are tough at home no doubt.  Dallas plays at home though.  The NFL is one of the four major professional sports leagues in North America,
Bot: I wonder if they will ever go higher than the 32 teams or are they just going to keep moving teams around.  How many times can LA get a team and then they move.  Rams, Raiders..they have both moved several times from there already.
 <|endoftext|> 
User: Lol, not doubt I've enjoyed this chat.  One last cool fact, Former partiots rb benjarvus green-ellis has never fumbled the football in his nfl career.
Bot: I saw that- talk about a great statistic!!  Do you know who he played for?  Name isn't familiar to me. I guess I also thought the Super Bowl went back further than 1960's 70's? 
 <|endoftext|> 
User: Hi there. Do you like the Packers? It is the 3rd oldest franchise in the NFL.
Bot: Hi! I love the Packers, actually! But I don't love how the waiting list for season tickets exceeds 100k names and nearly 30 years! That is just ridiculous!
 <|endoftext|> 
User: Yes that is crazy indeed. They are the only community owned not for profit franchise!
Bot: That is one aspect I do love about the Packers as well! I also think it's funny that in the 2011 Super Bowl, the Steelers entered to the song "Black and Yellow" by Wiz Khalifa while the Packers came out to the remix by Lil Wayne "Green and Yellow". I wonder if that was intentional? Ha!
 <|endoftext|> 
User: Yes that is very funny! The packers are actually named after the Indian Packing Company! Wonder how that happened?
Bot: I wonder that as well! But I think it's surprising they've been playing home games at Lambeau Field since 1957. That's a very long time!
 <|endoftext|> 
User: Yes that is very historic. They have sold out every game in that place since 1960!
Bot: That is unbelievable! I do love how there's a clock at Lambeau that's set 15 minutes early to honor Vince Lombardi as he always believed if you aren't 15 minutes early, you're late. I absolutely love that quote!
 <|endoftext|> 
User: Yes that is a great quote very sentimental. The first team to ever beat the packers was the Beloit Fairies. Must be the Packers no lol.
Bot: Ha! That's funny but also embarrassing! Speaking of historical facts, did you know the first playoff game in the NFL was played on an 80 yard long dirt field back in 1932? The field was actually home to the NHL's Blackhawks!
 <|endoftext|> 
User: Wow that is cool. When did they switch to 100 yards? The footballers didn't always make so much money, in the 60's they were out profited by bowlers!
Bot: That is so sad considering how rough football is compared to how easy bowling is. Fast forward to today, they've come so far in football, they're sticking these tracking chips in the players' shoulder pads to record their every move. I'm glad they can afford to do that now!
 <|endoftext|> 
User: Exactly. Good point. The formers Pats running back Green-Ellis never once fumbled the ball!
Bot: Now that takes serious talent and skill! It kind of reminds of Ben Roethlisberger. He has the most wins as a QB in the Browns' home stadium since they were reintroduced in the league and he plays for the Steelers! Ha!
 <|endoftext|> 
User: Oh yeah he was great. Big Ben! ESPN won an emmy for creating that yellow first down marker. Quite a cool creation!
Bot: That is very cool and innovative! I also think those huge, 1,100 pound American flags at football games are cool as well although the cost to make them being $50k isn't.
 <|endoftext|> 
User: Holy cow that is expensive! I wonder how much it cost for the Iowa football team to pain their locker room pink?
Bot: There is no telling, honestly! But on a similar note, Snoop Dog actually wrote a high school fight song for the football team his son plays for that I would like to hear!
 <|endoftext|> 
User: That is so cool. I wonder  what Snoop Dogg would think of the highest score ever in a football game being 222-0? Well it was great talking with you.
Bot: He probably wouldn't be too happy about it! I wonder if that game was played in one of the 14 of the 25 largest stadiums in the world that are US football teams? Ha! Well it was great chatting with you as well!
 <|endoftext|> 
User: What do you think about the NFL week 5 tips?
Bot: I don't follow the NFL usually until around the playoffs. Are you a fan?
 <|endoftext|> 
User: I am a fan, my favorite team is the Patriots and I will be rooting for them on Sunday.
Bot: Do you know much about the Packers? I've heard that they were named after a company.
 <|endoftext|> 
User: A bit, its not my favorite team but I do know some interesting facts, and I heard it was an indean company
Bot: The team is named after a packing company, but it's owned by the community. A non-profit company that must make insane amounts of cash.
 <|endoftext|> 
User: Well if its the whole community then that makes things easier but I agree, there must be a lot of cash involved and every game is sold out.
Bot: Sold old for decades! I wonder how they charge for tickets. Also, is there much else to do in Green Bay on a Sunday? 
 <|endoftext|> 
User: I havent been there but could be a boring place, the first team to beat them was the Beloit Fairies
Bot: I wonder who chose that name. The Fairies?Did you know that the NFL has no rule against women in the league.
 <|endoftext|> 
User: I don't think women can meet the qualifications for playing.
Bot: I wonder whether they could have women in positions like punter and kicker. The women have been cheerleaders. Men could be cheerleaders too!
 <|endoftext|> 
User: Yeah but cheerleaders dont get hit by others, but a punter or kicker might be a good position, you know ESPN won an Emmy for the ceation of the yellor first down line.
Bot: That yellow line is useful for viewers, who get only 11 minutes of action on average. How many minutes of commercials?
 <|endoftext|> 
User: apparently 3 quarters of commercials and barely a quarter of actual gameplay, but it sure seems longer than that.
Bot: The game of football has come a long way. In the 1960s the best bowlers made much more than football stars. Nowadays, I wonder what the difference is.
 <|endoftext|> 
User: Wow, I guess football wasnt that popular back in the 60s, you know a running back from the patriots never fumbled a ball in his entire career.
Bot: The guy must have had incredible hands or special gloves! I bet he was a good choice for fantasy football, too! 
 <|endoftext|> 
User: I bet he was, probably worth a few points, did you know the locker room for the visiting team at the University of Iowa is painted pink
Bot: I guess they're hoping to psych out the opposition. 
 <|endoftext|> 
User: Hey did you ever watch the XFL back in the day? It was the one created by Vince McMahon I think
Bot: I never saw that one.  I only watched the regular NFL
 <|endoftext|> 
User: Yes it was created by the person who created the WWE, so it's kind of based on wrestling in a way, I guess it's coming back which is interesting because I think the NFL could use some competition
Bot: Yes I wonder what they will pay the players?  Pro football players do well now but back in the 60's bowlers made more.
 <|endoftext|> 
User: Yep you're right about that. I don't know how popular will be so I don't know how much money they'll make but it is interesting that the salaries of the sports have changed over time like you mentioned
Bot: Yes some players really deserve the big money - like the Patriots Green-Ellis who has never fumbled the football his whole NFL career
 <|endoftext|> 
User: Yeah they should definitely pay him a lot of money, he's amazing! Have you ever watched a game on the television? The yellow line that marks the first down is actually something that was developed by ESPN and they won an Emmy for it
Bot: That is a very cool invention.  I thought the Super Bowl was boring this year but it had to have been better than the Georgia Tech win 222-0.
 <|endoftext|> 
User: Yep that game would have been a blowout and very boring haha. Good on Georgia Tech though, Cumberland fans must have been very disappointed that day
Bot: I cannot imagine were still there by halftime!  Its funny despite the big salaries in the NFL an engineer usually makes a higher lifetime income
 <|endoftext|> 
User: I wouldn't think that would happen youre right, what do you think about how NFL players treat the cheerleaders though?
Bot: Its awful!  New Orleans won't even let the cheerleaders in the same restaurant as a player.  What would they do if a woman ever joined the league?
 <|endoftext|> 
User: Yep that's a great point! Would the girl have to not meet with the other players in restaurants? Who knows, do you ever watch wrestling by the way?
Bot: I am not a big fan,  Apparently Abe Lincoln is a good wrestler though
 <|endoftext|> 
User: Yep he was really good at it, and so was the famous philosopher Plato
Bot: laugh that is funny.  Watching it in turkey might be more interesting - they douse themselves in olive oil!
 <|endoftext|> 
User: That sounds really slippery haha. What do you think about Macho Man's outfit design? Apparently the same designer made clothes for Aerosmith and also Jimi Hendrix
Bot: They have some bizarre clothing.  I just would not want to arm wrestle Cyplenkov - that dude is strong!
 <|endoftext|> 
User: No definitely not! Apparently wrestling is very popular though, and they have Incorporated the moves into a lot of other hand to hand combat systems which is interesting
Bot: Yes I find sumo wrestling in Japan interesting - those guys do not seem to be the most fit
 <|endoftext|> 
User: do you like wrestling?
Bot: Not really but I hear a wrestler has the biggest muscled hands in the world 
 <|endoftext|> 
User: Wo. In Turkey, they lather themselves in oil and then they wrestle
Bot: WOw sounds really slippery. Macho Man Randy savage used to be as football payers before he started wrestling
 <|endoftext|> 
User: Nice. Even Abe Lincoln was a wrestle hall of famer
Bot: Lincoln the president was?
 <|endoftext|> 
User: Yup he only lost one match out of 300
Bot: wow impressive. There used to be octopus wrestling matches as a sport
 <|endoftext|> 
User: Wow that is pretty cruel n my opinion
Bot: I know that was back in the 40s and 60s in the west coast
 <|endoftext|> 
User: I know that was before he became interested in philosophy
Bot: Cool. Same with Neil Degrasee Tyson, he was a champion at Harvard
 <|endoftext|> 
User: Wow. Do you like football?
Bot: I do. DId you know SNoop Dog wrote a song for his son's high school team?
 <|endoftext|> 
User: No idea. DO you know bowlers made more than football players in the 60s?
Bot: I guess it was a much more popular sport back in the day
 <|endoftext|> 
User: So, you familiar at all with wrestling?  I used to watch it regularly (that is, TV wrestling) years ago, but haven't seen it in awhile.  Did you know Abraham Lincoln is in the wrestling hall of fame because he only lost once out of 300 matches?  I find that amazing!
Bot: It is surprising to say the least.  I used to sell coca-cola at pro wrestling matches when I was 12.  Of course it was fake.  Wrestling can be entertainment or true competition.
 <|endoftext|> 
User: I've got a friend who was a wrestler (not professional but still) and he always preferred the term "scripted".  Tell him it was fake and he's liable to body slam ya and say, "Did that feel fake, to you?":  LOL.  My brother used to wrestle in high school, course he was the sports guy in our family so he did about every sport imaginable.  
Bot: I saw video of Hulk Hogan caused hearing damage to John Stossel by slapping his huge hands to Stossel's ear at the same time.  They put on a show and wear costumes.  Macho Man's wrestling gear was designed by a guy who designed clothes for Aerosmith.
 <|endoftext|> 
User: Wow, I can see that.. you look at 80s rockers and 80s wrestlers and their costumes are so flamboyantly similar.  Did you ever meet anyone famous while selling cola at events?  
Bot: There was a wrestler named Gorgeous George who was semi famous year's ago.  Even Plato wrestled before he decided to start writing smart things.
 <|endoftext|> 
User: Believe it or not, I know a bit about Gorgeous George, he's the guy who really defined being a heel: going around calling people "peasants" and trying to be the daintiest wrestler he could, having a valet spray perfume on the other wrestlers and the audience... hilarious stuff
Bot: Well, I met him one evening when he toured to wrestle in my home town (Oklahoma City).  He is sort of like Ali and Dieon Sanders who made themselves more famous by far out behavior.  Great marketing of self.  Football did some marketing to go from paying less than top bowlers in 1960 to salaries today.
 <|endoftext|> 
User: Yeah, I've heard about that.. I've been told back then bowling was a way bigger deal than it was now, they even had celebrity bowling shows and stuff.  Seems unfair that bowlers made more considering football is more dangerous, injury wise.  Did you know, there's actually no rule in the NFL barring women from being football players?  If they pass the requirements, that is...
Bot: I doubt that we will see any female in the game except maybe for a kicker.  I love the yellow line marking the line to reach for a first down that ESPN developed.
 <|endoftext|> 
User: Yeah, it's amazing how detailed they can get with the graphics on football games nowadays.  I remember back when it was just one guy (usually Madden) and he had to "draw in" the white line pointing to everything. ("And you got the guy going here...")  hehe.  So, did you play any sports when you were younger?
Bot: I played football in high school.  But I was a back-up at QB and only got on the field as a corner back on defense.  I never saw anything as debilitating as the pink visitor's room at Iowa University.
 <|endoftext|> 
User: Yeah, isn't that a trip?  Pink has a psychological effect on people.  They say they did a study where the turned a weight room pink and found the lifters suddenly couldn't lift as much as they normally could.  Me, like I said, I was never much a sports player, but my brother got a football scholarship to college.
Bot: That's great for you brother and for your parents.  I have heard that about the effects of pink walls.  When I was on our JV, we played the varsity of another school and lost 74-0 which does not compare to the highest score by Georgia Tech of 222-0
 <|endoftext|> 
User: Oh man, can't imagine what a blow to one's self-esteem losing 222 to zero would be!  Especially crazy considering the average NFL game only has 11 minutes of live gameplay.  I think after the first 100 points you'd be like, "Uh, can we just forfeit, please?"  LOL
Bot: No doubt about it.  I think in our blow-out they let the clock run continuously even after incomplete passes.  Did you watch the 2 of the 32 NFL teams square of in the Super Bowl last Sunday?
 <|endoftext|> 
User: No, I missed it.  Heard a lot people say it wasn't the most exciting of games though.  Many were even ragging on Maroon 5 for playing the half-time show.  Hey, get this, do you know they put chips in the players shoulder pads and the football to track movements?  Neat, huh?
Bot: Technology continues to change our lives.  That game is usually on the first Sunday of February and this year was no exception.
 <|endoftext|> 
User: Some of the rules to play football are pretty strict.  Did you know for instance if you're a cheerleader for the Saints, you're forbidden from EATING at the same restaurant as any NFL player, and if they happen to show up in the middle of their meal, they gotta leave?  Guess they're serious about the no fraternizing rule...
Bot: I read that those chips are also in the football so they can tract the dimensions of forward passes and other things.
 <|endoftext|> 
User: Yeah, it's probably helpful for keeping all the players stats up to date.  Did you know patriots RB Benjarvus has never fumbling the football in his NFL career?  That's pretty impressive considering how fast it can travel and all the other pressures.
Bot: Sure is.  By the way, I know track from tract.  Just a type.  Nice talking with you!
 <|endoftext|> 
User: Do you like wrestling?
Bot: I'm not a huge fan of it, but part of it is due to that I don't understand all the logistics. What about you?
 <|endoftext|> 
User: I used to watch it back before it exploded in poplularity in the 90s.  Did you know that Plato lead a professional wrestling career before becoming a famous pholospher?
Bot: Maybe something about wrestling made him philosophical. Abe Lincoln was also well-known for wrestling
 <|endoftext|> 
User: I never knew that about Abe.  I'm going to have to look that up.
Bot: He's actually in the wrestling hall of fame because he only lost 1 in 300 matches
 <|endoftext|> 
User: I never ever heard that about him.  He was pretty tall though so he probably had some good leverage.  The Turkish national sport is oil wrestling where men douse themselves in olive oil and wrestle.  That's kind of different...and odd at the same time.  lol
Bot: That also sounds dangerous, which might be why it's not super popular
 <|endoftext|> 
User: Yes.  The man who designed Macho Man's wrestling gear was also the same guy who designed clothes for a lot rock stars like Jimi Hendrix and Aerosmith.
Bot: He must have known what material to use. Do you know who Denis Cyplenkov is?
 <|endoftext|> 
User: I've never heard of him.  Who is he?
Bot: He's a bodybuilder and arm wrestling champion, which is aided by the fact that his hands are the largest and most densely muscled in the world
 <|endoftext|> 
User: Nice.  Did you know that the university of Iowa's vistors locker room was painted pink?
Bot: That's either got to be a result of psychology or that's the color that was on sale
 <|endoftext|> 
User: LOL  Former Patriots running back Benjarvus Green Ellis never fumbled the ball once during his NFL career.  Impressive indeed.
Bot: That's an impressive feat for just a season, let alone a whole career!
 <|endoftext|> 
User: I agree!  In the 1960's top bowlers made twice as much as the top football stars of the day.  
Bot: That was before ESPN came up with the nifty yellow first down line though. That's worth an Emmy, if you ask me
 <|endoftext|> 
User: I agree!  It comes in handy when we're watching the actual 11 minutes of live gameplay per game.
Bot: The embedded chips in the footballs and shoulder pads also help with that
 <|endoftext|> 
User: Are you a football fan?
Bot: I watch football every now and then, but I think the XFL is just a bad idea, regular football players are injured enough without adding "extreme" stuff to it.
 <|endoftext|> 
User: yeah, I think the XFL is a bad idea as well. Football is pretty extreme in my opinon. 
Bot: Well since the found was Vince McMahon, it really is not a surprise he would try to start something like XFl. guess he wanted to try his hand at other sports.
 <|endoftext|> 
User: Vince McMahon is hilarious though. Does he still do the WWE, or is it no good anymore? 
Bot: Yeah he is still doing WWE and when he retires, which he should have done already since he is 73, his son in law will take over, and I do not think it will be any better under him.
 <|endoftext|> 
User: He's 73? Wholly molly, I'm not a huge fan of Shane though, is his son in law still Triple H? 
Bot: Yeah Still HHH, Shane is alright, he runs the Smackdown brand while his sister runs the RAW brand, and Smackdown is actually much better than RAW, at least for now.
 <|endoftext|> 
User: Interesting, you know a long time ago I met Hogan, Chris Benoit, Miss Elizabeth, Macho Man, Mr. Perfect at a bar in baltimore, The Marriot hotel bar. I have pictures with all of them, the only one that isn't dead is Hogan. 
Bot: Yeah what happened to Chris Benoit was crazy, he was one of my favorite wrestlers when i was younger, until he decided to go crazy.
 <|endoftext|> 
User: Yeah, I feel bad for him. Nash and Hall were there too. I can't remember if this was a WWC or WWF event. 
Bot: More than likely it was WCW, they were pretty big at that time.
 <|endoftext|> 
User: Yeah, it was pretty cool. I'm fairly certain it was WCW because Hogan was behind the bar acting like he had all of these important phone calls.
Bot: I still try to keep up with WWE but it has really fallen off lately, the attitude era was the amazing back in the day but now they have the pg era and it is just really bad sometimes.
 <|endoftext|> 
User: I don't have time for it anymore. What ever happened to Eric Bischoff? 
Bot: He managed RAW for a short time, but he is not really around any more, I think he still works fopr WWE but he is a higher up now
 <|endoftext|> 
User: Interesting. I thought he was funny. My favorite was Razor Ramon (Scott hall), but he is really messed up now. 
Bot: Yeah Scott hall was pretty bad, but recently Diamond Dallas Page has gotten him started on his training and helped him get straightened out a lot.
 <|endoftext|> 
User: I saw that special on that. Pretty cool stuff. I think he needed some type of transplant too. 
Bot: Yeah he did, but WWE has gone away from actual wrestling and stunts and more toward entertainment, The WWE does not even call them wrestlers anymore, they are called Superstars or entertainers, part of the reason the pg era is so bad.
 <|endoftext|> 
User: Do you like the NFL?
Bot: Yes I like the NFL, what do you think about the Redskins mascot though? You think it's racist?
 <|endoftext|> 
User: I think it could be worst, idk, what do you think?
Bot: Yeah it's tough because I can see why it's racist but on the other hand I can see why it's been that way for a long time and maybe it's not, I just don't know LOL
 <|endoftext|> 
User: for sure, you have a valid point.. Do you have a favorite team of the 32 nfl teams?
Bot: Well I really like the Patriots myself, what about you? I think Tom Brady is awesome
 <|endoftext|> 
User: He is very good. What do you think about the saints?
Bot: Well I don't like the fact that they treat their cheerleaders poorly, but I'm sure they use tracking chips for players on the field, I wonder if they use those same chips to track the locations of their cheerleaders
 <|endoftext|> 
User: Right, it is sexist. I am sure they do lol. Engineers who made those chips make more than most players do over their life
Bot: LOL you're right about that. I just don't know why you would need to know the balls rotational speed, it seems like just knowing the players locations and speed would be enough
 <|endoftext|> 
User: For sure, but they need to be all high tech now. Do you watch college football at all?
Bot: Time to time. I also watch some high school because my friend's son plays, it would be cool if Snoop Dogg made my friend's son a theme song for his football team
 <|endoftext|> 
User: lol I would like that. I am an Iowa Hawkeye fan, they paint the visiting locker room pink
Bot: I heard about that that's pretty funny LOL, what do you think about the high school football team that is building a 60 million dollar football stadium
 <|endoftext|> 
User: that is ridiculous. a waste of tax payer money!
Bot: Yep I agree with you! And it only has eighteen thousand people, how is that possible
 <|endoftext|> 
User: right, you would think like 100000, oh well
Bot: They're definitely not making a smart decision! did you know that those huge American flags at football stadiums actually weigh like a thousand pounds
 <|endoftext|> 
User: That is so much! How do you think they get them up there?
Bot: Yeah I've no idea! And I also don't know why someone would pay $50,000 for one of those flags that's just too much
 <|endoftext|> 
User: Hi there.  I guess I will learn a bit about wrestling
Bot: So with the XFL, do you know much about that, it's new to me.
 <|endoftext|> 
User: Not familiar with wrestling at all.  Although I have read 1 thing I always thought.  The sport can either be "theatrical" or competitive.
Bot: The theatrical side comes to my mind when I think wrestling.  That probably drives people that properly wrestle mad, that they are not taken seriously.
 <|endoftext|> 
User: I like the turkish.  They wrestle in olive oil!!
Bot: Seems like a waste of olive oil, they should use cheaper stuff, like the budget brand from the supermarket.
 <|endoftext|> 
User: LOL  The good 'ole wesson oil!!  Wonder if honest abe wrestled in oil.
Bot: Isn't oil good for a beard?  So is XFL a mixture of NFL and wrestling, or is just a lower form of football?
 <|endoftext|> 
User: Don't know.  It is a football I believe.
Bot: To be honest I'm not interested in football, so I can't imagine getting excited about another league.  There must be some gimmick to get people involved?
 <|endoftext|> 
User: Not much of a football fan here either.  Wasn't aware that there are no rules against females in the football league.
Bot: Maybe that will be the gimmick?  I'm glad my kids have no interest in football, I want my son to be active but not the expense of his brain.
 <|endoftext|> 
User: It's a tough sport for sure.  Guess there are risks in all sports though.  Except maybe swimming.  As long as you're not with piranhas.
Bot: Maybe bowling too, were we in the sixties it sounds like there was money in it, not sure about now.
 <|endoftext|> 
User: That 's  a surprising trivia fact for me.  Don't even see any bowling alleys anymore.  Was enjoyable too.
Bot: A mix of wrestling and bowling would be an interesting concept, I could see if Vince McMahon is interested.
 <|endoftext|> 
User: LOL  Played in the Audi Field with car racing!!
Bot: Yeah, lets get as much involved as possible, it's like fusion cooking but for sports.  Unlike the NFL we could a written rule saying women have to play.
 <|endoftext|> 
User: The year of woman..Why not?  Nice chatting with you!!
Bot: You too, I'm going to grab the olive oil, not saying what for cooking or wrestling.  Have a good day. Bye.
 <|endoftext|> 
User: Have you heard of xfl?
Bot: I have. I watched it in 2001
 <|endoftext|> 
User: They are relaunching in 2020 and will have 8 cities that will host franchises. 
Bot: I heard. I hope it goes better this time
 <|endoftext|> 
User: Hopefully so, it is supposed to be different than the 2001 run. They are going to be looking for players released from the NFL, so maybe there will be better playing. 
Bot: Yeah. It was interesting I guess with He Hate Me and all that, but the actual football was terrible
 <|endoftext|> 
User: I think it will be hard to compare to the NFL. Most people want to watch really good players playing good football.
Bot: That's true. They'll definitely need to keep some of the entertainment stuff involved to keep people engaged
 <|endoftext|> 
User: They are trying to get away from the WWE and I think this could come back to hurt them. They need something else to attract viewers, especially since the NFL is around. 
Bot: I dunno. I kind of agree with getting away from the WWE, but only if they can replace that with something entertaining. It's a fine line
 <|endoftext|> 
User: Right, they will definitely need that entertainment factor. 
Bot: Yeah. The list of cities is interesting. Nothing in the midwest
 <|endoftext|> 
User: I think they are signing with United to use some of the stadiums. I guess they are looking for cities that will have a larger fan base.
Bot: What do you mean by United?
 <|endoftext|> 
User: The United league, Soccer.
Bot: Oh, I'm not familiar with that. Is that what MLS is known as?
 <|endoftext|> 
User: The United has a lot of good teams! Atlanta United is one of them!
Bot: Oh cool. The only United I know is Manchester :)
 <|endoftext|> 
User: Hopefully they will be able to work out the scheduling issues for when soccer, football, and xfl overlap.
Bot: Yeah. They could offset the NFL and XFL seasons as a start. Help with scheduling and attendance
 <|endoftext|> 
User: That is a good idea. That can help with the wear and tear on the field as well.
Bot: Yeah, not a bad idea overall
 <|endoftext|> 
User: There is enough funding for them for 5 years, so hopefully they can become figure something out and make it become successful.
Bot: Yeah I wouldn't mind an alternative to the NFL. Hopefully it works out
 <|endoftext|> 
User: Hi, how are you?
Bot: I am well thank you. Do you enjoy the NFL by any  chance?
 <|endoftext|> 
User: I do like the NFL. I also know that Derwin James is going to wing the rookie defensive player of the year so it is pretty much an easy choice at this point.
Bot: Congratulations to him. He deserves it. I can't there are 32 teams and we end up with the Patriots in the Superbowl again. That's upsetting. 
 <|endoftext|> 
User: You're not a Pats fan? Do you like the NFL?
Bot: No. I don't like the cheating scandals and even more than that I'm just sick of seeing them in the Superbowl. It's boring at this point. I do like the NFL. Did you know that there is only 11 minutes of live gameplay in a game on average?
 <|endoftext|> 
User: Wow, that's not a lot. Who is your favorite team?
Bot: I am a Bears fan. They actually had a good season this year until that playoff game messed it all up. How about you?
 <|endoftext|> 
User: Me too! It was a nice year! I was shocked they did that well. Since our draft pick went to OAK, I wanted them to do well since our draft position would be unaffected.
Bot: Yes they did very well. Mack was a great addition. Did you know that the NFL has no written rules prohibiting female players?
 <|endoftext|> 
User: Seems like they are trying not to be sexists but the objectification of their cheerleaders seem counter to that goal.
Bot: Yes it does. I know that Saints cheerleaders can't eat in the same restaurant as players and if they are there first an a player enters they have to leave. That's very upsetting. 
 <|endoftext|> 
User: Yeah. I wonder how much an older white guy being owner affects that? Tom Benson has a conservative viewpoint.
Bot: I'm not sure but it's crazy to me. Who cares if they eat at the same place? I did not know that they use tracking chips in players shoulder pads and footballs. I wonder why they use replays to make calls then?
 <|endoftext|> 
User: I know. I was watching the Australian open and was amazed at the timeliness and speed of their challenges. Seems like the NFL has a ways to go!
Bot: That seems to be the case. Were you aware that ESPN created the yellow line that we see onscreen showing the marker for first down?
 <|endoftext|> 
User: I think I knew that. I thin they won an emmy for it...
Bot: Yes they did. I can't imagine watching a game without it. Since we discussed the Patriots earlier, Benjarvus Green-Ellis never fumbled a football his entire career. I don't know how that is possible. 
 <|endoftext|> 
User: I don't know why he is not employed then! I love the yellow line. I remember telling my wife that they had guys move it on everyfirst down, hoping the players didn't trip over it...
Bot: Ha ha, that's funny. I can't believe that in the 60's bowlers made more than NFL players! I didn't know it was ever that popular. 
 <|endoftext|> 
User: So do you watch much football?  I enjoy watching NFL from time to time.  They have 32 teams.
Bot: I do like the NFL.  My favorite team is one of the AFC teams, the Baltimore Ravens.
 <|endoftext|> 
User: They have a 17 week season that runs from early September to later in December.  I wonder if they are pretty tired by the end of the season.
Bot: I would think.  Maybe those fancy sensors and tracking chips they have embedded in their shoulder pads could give some insight.
 <|endoftext|> 
User: Did you know that an average NFL game only has 11 minutes of live play.
Bot: I didn't know that.  It certainly seems much longer.  The NFL is coming up on a 100 year anniversary in not too long.  They started in 1932.
 <|endoftext|> 
User: wow I didn't know it had been that long.  The biggest game is at the end of the season called the Super Bowl.
Bot: Right!  And it's normally played on the first Sunday in February.
 <|endoftext|> 
User: It's played by one of the two leagues in the NFC and AFC
Bot: The Super Bowl is pretty amazing.  It's such a spectacle.  Hard to believe the first NFL playoff game was played on a dirt field.
 <|endoftext|> 
User: I read that that average lifetime earnings of an engineer is higher than the average lifetime earnings of an NFL player and an average MLB player
Bot: Doesn't surprise me.  Many NFL careers are quite short.  The league does generate a ton of money though.  Even college football is about the cash.  14 of the 25 largest stadiums belong to College football teams.
 <|endoftext|> 
User: Wow thats crazy!  I read something strange about the New Orleans Saints.  Apparently the cheerleaders can't eat in the same restaurant as the football players
Bot: That hardly seems fair.  I guess it is what it is though. I find it interesting that those huge American Flags can weigh up to 1100 pounds. 
 <|endoftext|> 
User: No way! That's a lot!  It even says that if they are already eating there and a football player walks in, they are required to leave.  Seems strange.
Bot: For sure.  I like football, but also chess too.  Do you play?  I think it would be interesting to see the 3 player chess game.
 <|endoftext|> 
User: I actually have never played.  I did see though that there are more possible moves in a game of chess than there are atoms in the known universe.  Do you think thats true?
Bot: I find that hard to believe.  I've been playing since I was a kid, but don't play too often anymore.  I never knew that each pawn used to have it's own name.
 <|endoftext|> 
User: I read that the president of the world chess federation believes that chess was invented by aliens.  LOL
Bot: That's just crazy.  Some magicians are quite good at chess.
 <|endoftext|> 
User: I saw that the chess grandmaster Judit Polgar beat a family friend at age 5 without looking at the board.  Crazy!
Bot: That is crazy.  Well, it's been nice chatting with you.
 <|endoftext|> 
User: Hello, have you heard of the Redskins before?
Bot: hi how are you? the redskins? a football team?
 <|endoftext|> 
User: Yeah the same one, they have the 13th pick it seems
Bot: does that position them well for the following season? 13th doesnt seem bad or good.
 <|endoftext|> 
User: I think its good, it can be worse, I hear ther are in the lookout of a great QB being in position 13th might ruin their chances
Bot: i guess they can trade up if they need to. who was/is the current qb? alex something? 
 <|endoftext|> 
User: Not sure about that, they do draft Jonathan Allen last season his a great player but they still need others
Bot: who i j allen? is he the next greatest qb?
 <|endoftext|> 
User: Not sure his positiion he is #17 of the team though, theres also Sean Tyler another promosing talen
Bot: i dont follow football much. what do you think of women in the nfl?
 <|endoftext|> 
User: I think they would be at a dissadvantage theres no rule against them paying but it would be kind of unfair and dangerous for them
Bot: yeah, i agree. not much point really. what does it prove? maybe as a kicker, but still, what does that prove?
 <|endoftext|> 
User: Maybe as a kicker yeah, they should have their own devision, now thats something I would watch
Bot: i think that it would be good to start the game at the high school level, build interest and a number of players. then see how things go.
 <|endoftext|> 
User: Maybe some day, so do you like to play chess?
Bot: i used to play a bit. i was an interesting game. now i dont. You?
 <|endoftext|> 
User: I like it, a board with 64 squares and a 8x8 grid, there are a lot of moves and strategies so cool game
Bot: yeah, it is a simple game with complex strategy. that is the best part. easy to learn rules, but no limit to the possibilities.
 <|endoftext|> 
User: There are more games in the game that atoms in the known universe how crazy is that
Bot: that sounds about right. i cant imagine any two games going the same way. anyway, great chat!
 <|endoftext|> 
User: hi how are you? what do you think of the game of chess?
Bot: I think it is a really complex game. There are more moves in chess than atoms in the universe
 <|endoftext|> 
User: it is complex. I played a bit when I was young. I don't play now. I think it takes tremendous concentration.
Bot: There's a grandmaster who was able to win a game without looking at the board at age 5
 <|endoftext|> 
User: Man, some people just have a gift for the game. it really requires a certain mindset. some people think math is related to chess ability, but I don't think so.
Bot: A 2007 study discovered a negative correlation between iq and chess skill
 <|endoftext|> 
User: That would make sense. i think that IQ tests do not capture the intelligence of chess.
Bot: What do you think of chess being invented by aliens?
 <|endoftext|> 
User: That is a silly idea. the board is simple. the pieces are simple. the complexity comes from the possibilities, not from aliens. Why would the aliens give us chess?
Bot: Maybe the Chess grandmaster knows something we do not
 <|endoftext|> 
User: Yes, maybe he does, or maybe he is an alien trying to use reverse psychology to throw us off the scent! LOL
Bot: Are you into football?
 <|endoftext|> 
User: I sometimes watch football. more than chess! LOL
Bot: I'm sure a lot of people do! Did you know ESPN won an Emmy for the yellow first down line
 <|endoftext|> 
User: Yeah, i heard that. i guess they must have been the first to superimpose graphics on the field.
Bot: Yeah they completely recreate the playing surface. Its pretty cool
 <|endoftext|> 
User: Yes, i see a lot of graphics on the field now. quite useful for the viewers. 
Bot: Football has come a long way. Financially as well. Professional bowlers use to make twice as much as players
 <|endoftext|> 
User: I think the football players made very little, so I don't know how much the bowlers made. Anyway, great chat!
Bot: I wonder if a pink locker room actually has an effect on players
 <|endoftext|> 
User: I doubt it. well, maybe a small one. Anyway, great chat!
Bot: you as well have a great day!
 <|endoftext|> 
User: Are you a Patriots fan or a fan of Trump?
Bot: I'm more of a Patriots fan than a fan of Donald Trump. 
 <|endoftext|> 
User: Trump holds Kraft, Belichick and Brady in high regard; he has called them winners in the past
Bot: Yes, Trump like's to associate himself with anything in the popular culture that is a winner. But the Pats seem "self made" unlike the Donald. 
 <|endoftext|> 
User: The Patriots also know how to conduct themselves as winners and come back from behind.
Bot: Yes, I see the parallel between the Falcons - Patriots Superbowl and Trump's victory in 2016. I think that comparison is apt. 
 <|endoftext|> 
User: ESPN does not favor the Patriots nearly as much as Fox favors Trump
Bot: Hmmm. Yes. I never knew that ESPN was against the Patriots, but they did really pump up Deflategate. Funny that ESPN is seen as a rival of the Pats when they are based in Connecticut. 
 <|endoftext|> 
User: I think Deflategate was just a big distraction to other issues around the country
Bot: Sports new can be a big distraction. Did you know that the Patriots were the NFL's whitest team?
 <|endoftext|> 
User: Doesn't surprise me given where they are located
Bot: I would assume that them being white is just coincidence than someone contrived. 
 <|endoftext|> 
User: I have been a big fan of the Patriots since Brady starting playing 
Bot: I'm amazed by Brady. He's a pretty amazing story. I don't really get the Patriots "hate" (if there is such a thing) across the country. 
 <|endoftext|> 
User: I think it goes to the fact the the Patriots under Bellichick have won over 20 post season games and are always on top season after season
Bot: Yes. I have joined the bandwagon as a fan. I have to admit that I wanted the Rams to win the Patriots first Superbowl, though. 
 <|endoftext|> 
User: I was so mad when they were down to the Falcons a couple years back at halftime by 25 points. I never thought they would come back
Bot: Probably the most amazing comeback in Superbowl history. In fact, I don't know if there's been a comeback in NFL history that has been so epic. 
 <|endoftext|> 
User: Atlanta will never forget for sure...lol
Bot: Where do you stand - was it more of an Atlanta "meltdown" or a New England come back?
 <|endoftext|> 
User: Do you follow the Patriots?
Bot: Good morning!  I follow the NFL very closely.  I am sick of the Patriots!  Hard to believe they were once lovable underdogs this century!
 <|endoftext|> 
User: Now they are the favorite at every turn, the owner gifted a jersey to our president
Bot: Yea, I know Tom Brady keeps a MAGA hat in his locker during interviews.  Bob Kraft and Trump are good friends.  Kraft is a member at Mar A Lago.
 <|endoftext|> 
User: He does thats new to me, cray how prior to 2001 season they never won a title and now they are the team with the most Superbowl titles under their belt
Bot: Yup, do you watch Game of Thrones at all?  I thought it was hilarious the author called the Pats, "the Lannisters of the NFL."
 <|endoftext|> 
User: I do watch it and that makes sense lol the Pats have dominated the league for many years now
Bot: It is crazy how dominant they have been.  15 AFC East titles in 17 years in a sport with that much free agency is just unfathomable!
 <|endoftext|> 
User: 15 out of 17 no kidding!! that is amazing I dont think that will happen again in the history of the sport
Bot: Yea, I would agree.  We will not see that again.  I did not know until recently Gillette Stadium is equidistant from Boston and Providence.  Always thought it was much closer to Boston.
 <|endoftext|> 
User: I love that stadium its the home stadium to our team, did you hear about Superbowl 46 and how the Pats let the giants score a touchdown?
Bot: Yes, I remember that well.  Bold strategy, but the Giants won anyway!
 <|endoftext|> 
User: Yeah the Giants didnt want to score but they ended up scoring, I wonder if Bill Belichick was the coach
Bot: He was the coach for that game.  He has been the coach for the last 8 Patriots Super Bowl appearances, which is insane!!
 <|endoftext|> 
User: He is a great coach, I guess part of the succes of the patriots is thanks to him, did you know the Patriots also hold the record for more Superbowl losses in the NFL
Bot: Yes, I think they are actually tied with the poor Bills :(
 <|endoftext|> 
User: Yeah they hold the record with the Bills but at least we also hold the record of more Superbowl wins, not sure how many the Bills have won
Bot: Yup, goes to show you how good you can be if you are fundamentally sound like the Pats are.  For example, Benjarvus Green-Ellis never fumbled once in his whole career!  What a stat!
 <|endoftext|> 
User: It is an amazing stat, he must be the only one in NFL history, skilled player, he retired back in 2011 right?
Bot: That sounds about right!  A fun fact that not too many people know, the Browns last playoff win in 1995 was actually with Belichick as the head coach! 
 <|endoftext|> 
User: Belichick is a great coach a leyend not only for the Patriots then, anyways its been great chatting with you, lots of cool facts
Bot: Thanks, it was great chatting with you too!
 <|endoftext|> 
User: Did you see the Patriots win the Superbowl?
Bot: yes did you know that at one point in 2001 they were the underdogs - the game now is amazing
 <|endoftext|> 
User: I did not because it seems like they've been a dynasty forever now. Did you know that George RR Martin called the Patriots the Lannisters of the NFL? I think that's fitting. 
Bot: haha tat is funny, at this point they surely inspure envy and suspition with the scandals. but yes at one point brady was the 199th pick - can you guess the year?
 <|endoftext|> 
User: That's super shocking. No what year was it?
Bot: 2000 - he came from university of michigan. funny with a democratic state trump loves them because they are 'winners'
 <|endoftext|> 
User: Not for much longer, the stars are getting too old. Everyone also forgets that they are tied with the Bills for the most super bowl losses. 
Bot: right and gillette stadium is actually in foxborough mass, about an hour from boston so its not quite a 'boston' team
 <|endoftext|> 
User: They sure claim it. Did you know that in the 1960's top bowler's made more money than top football players? That's so strange. 
Bot: i love those weird facts. like the giant american flags weigh 1100 pounds and cost 50,000 to make!
 <|endoftext|> 
User: Wow! I was not aware of that. That's crazy. Are you familiar with Benjarvus Green-Ellis from the Patriots?
Bot: no tell me more about him 
 <|endoftext|> 
User: He never fumbled a football in his entire career and he was a running back! I don't know how that's possible. 
Bot: that sounds impossible! nearly as impossible is that th patriots have either won or lost by 3 or 4 points in all 6 tries
 <|endoftext|> 
User: Those are close games. Here's a fact about high scoring games. The highest scoring football game was in 1916 between Georgia Tech and Cumberland and the score was 222-0!
Bot: that is funny, poor cumberland. last playoff for cleveland browns was 1995 against the patriots
 <|endoftext|> 
User: I'm not surprised. They were so excited when they won their first game this year because it had been so long. Have you heard about the University of Iowa's locker room?
Bot: no is it cool? 
 <|endoftext|> 
User: They painted the visiting teams room pink. I'm assuming that's some kind of psychological warfare. 
Bot: oh no! that would make me want to win more! atleast the stadium didnt cost 60 million to build like a highschool in allen texas
 <|endoftext|> 
User: Hey there do you like the New England Patriots? And what do you think about Tom Brady?
Bot: I don't really care for the Patriots. Nor for Tom Brady. What do you think?
 <|endoftext|> 
User: I do like the Patriots personally. They do win all the time. Do you like Game of Thrones? The author of Game of Thrones does not like the Patriots apparently LOL
Bot: I haven't watched much of Game of Thrones or read the books. Why didn't he like them?
 <|endoftext|> 
User: Well I don't know exactly, but I do watch The Game of Thrones, and he says the Patriots are like the Lannisters. The Lannisters are definitely the bad guys in that show lol
Bot: Yikes that is a very unflattering comparison. I think the patriots are the yankees of football. Everyone loves to hate them. 
 <|endoftext|> 
User: Haha yes I can agree with you there. Do you like the Buffalo Bills by the way? They are equivalent to the New York Patriots, in terms of Super Bowl losses haha
Bot: I haven't ever heard of them actually. I'm a bit football illiterate. Is there a coach that is known as like the best in the league?
 <|endoftext|> 
User: Yes I think that's Bill Belichick, I think he's the best in the league, and it is an amazing record. He is the most winningest coach in the NFL postseason with 21 wins.
Bot: Wow that is quite a lot of wins. What team does he coach for right now?
 <|endoftext|> 
User: He coaches the New England Patriots. And I think he'll be there coach again next year. If they win again next year that would be insane! What do you think about the Cleveland Browns by the way?
Bot: I can't say that I know much about them. They are sort of one of those teams you hear about in passing but aren't any good so you dont' really give them a second thought. 
 <|endoftext|> 
User: Yeah that's true. I guess their last playoff win was back in 1995. that seems like so long ago!
Bot: Wow that is almost a quarter of a centuary ago!
 <|endoftext|> 
User: I know right! It doesn't seem that long ago, but it kind of was lol, did you hear about the pink locker room? You know, the one painted that way by the University of Iowa?
Bot: That is totally something I could see happening in Iowa. They love to razz opposing teams. 
 <|endoftext|> 
User: I wonder if it works though? I would play a lot better if I were put in a pink locker room LOL, what about you?
Bot: I would find it hilarious. I'm sure it was supposed to be some sort of play on pink being a girls color. Who knows with it being Iowa though. 
 <|endoftext|> 
User: Yeah that's true. have you gone bowling recently? Apparently bowling in the 60s, the top players made more than top football players, that's completely the opposite of now btw
Bot: It probably has a lot to do with the longevity of the career of a bowler vs a football player. It seems like football players have such a short career due to all the injuries. 
 <|endoftext|> 
User: Are you on Facebook?
Bot: Used to be, but I got fed up with their shenanigans. How long have you been on? Since early days?
 <|endoftext|> 
User: I was one of the first in 2006
Bot: Were you at least 13 years old then? 
 <|endoftext|> 
User: Yes, much older than that unfortunately
Bot: I heard that Myspace said no to the chance to buy FB for $75 mil in 2005. Oops.
 <|endoftext|> 
User: Mark Zuckerberg seems to be digging himself a big hole at Facebook nowadays
Bot: With all his cash, he could just buy an island and live there without worries. Have you heard about the BK promotion? I would unfriend and refriend to get many Whoppers.
 <|endoftext|> 
User: I didn't hear that one. Can you tell me more about it?
Bot: Burger King had a promotion where you'd get a free Whopper if you unfriended 10 people on FB. Not sure what the point was. Spread hate for your fast food cravings?
 <|endoftext|> 
User: How would they know?  Did they run the promotion on the radio?
Bot: I guess you would have to show them on your phone or something. Maybe there was a link on the website. Does anyone listen to radio anymore? Seems like YouTube is the only game around.
 <|endoftext|> 
User: All it takes to make one is a razorblade and a pencil.
Bot: If that radio got people "likes" on FB, it would be popular again. Do you know what CanCon is?
 <|endoftext|> 
User: I don't. What is it?
Bot: Canadian Content. In Canada, 40% of music must be Canadian in origin. Rush. More Rush. 
 <|endoftext|> 
User: I bet they play a lot of Justin Bieber, he is canadian I think.
Bot: Yeah, he's Canadian. Are you an NFL fan?
 <|endoftext|> 
User: I absolutely love NFL. I am watching game now
Bot: What game? Is it the Patriots? 
 <|endoftext|> 
User: Denver Oakland; I hope they combine for the most points in a game tonight
Bot: Got some money riding on it, eh?  Good luck!
 <|endoftext|> 
User: Hi, how are you doing today?
Bot: Great and yourself?
 <|endoftext|> 
User: I'm doing great! Do you use Facebook?
Bot: I do! I never knew about the Like button being illegal in Germany! Do you use Facebook?
 <|endoftext|> 
User: I don't. Never really saw the appeal, but I understand it helps people stay in touch. Myspace made a blunder. How much money did they miss out on?
Bot: They could've bought it for 75 million and now it's worth 104 billion!  Do you watch football?
 <|endoftext|> 
User: I sometimes watch. It's an interesting sport.
Bot: Do you watch American football, soccer, or rugby?  I didn't know an emmy could be won for a line LOL
 <|endoftext|> 
User: I watch American football around playoffs, and the World Cup for soccer. I guess the line was an big breakthrough for the game.
Bot: I like it when I watch on tv.  What do you think about the University of Iowa having a pink locker room for the visiting team?
 <|endoftext|> 
User: I would say that it's a cheap ploy to put the opposition in a softer mood. Can't imagine it works now.
Bot: Do you prefer to watch the games on tv or listen to them on the radio?
 <|endoftext|> 
User: Prefer the TV. The radio is great for talk shows and for music. And maybe the occasional weekly news program in classical Latin.
Bot: I would love to find the am station where you can hear the Jupiter radio storms. That's crazy!
 <|endoftext|> 
User: Probably better than most of the top 40 these days. The kids have their preferences, though. I guess Jupiter storms are old school.
Bot: I wonder if classic radio dramas could ever make a comeback?  They say everything eventually comes back in style right?
 <|endoftext|> 
User: I wonder if that's true in an age of video. Maybe researchers and professors will take an interest. 
Bot: Maybe that's something that someone at Harvard can re-develop and look into and test it with Harvard students, much like Mark Zuckerberg did with Facebook
 <|endoftext|> 
User: Put the Zuck on it. See what happens. Maybe get Burger King involved with a promotion  for a free whopper.
Bot: Burger King doesn't need the promotion, they already give enough money to Facebook with their advertisements
 <|endoftext|> 
User: True. I enjoyed chatting!
Bot: Me too! Have a great day!
 <|endoftext|> 
User: Good morning, are you a football fan?
Bot: Hi there. I really don't enjoy it, but I went to a big football college in the SEC, so I'm familiar enough haha.
 <|endoftext|> 
User: The SEC sure loves their football! The schools have to bring in some much money from those games.
Bot: They do, mostly from the broadcasting rights. The behind the scenes action can be pretty interesting, too--for example, the University of Iowa's visitor's locker room is painted pink.
 <|endoftext|> 
User: I wonder if they thought it would give them an advantage psychologically? I can't see that working though.
Bot: If anything it's going to give the visiting team more motivation, right? I wonder if teams of the variations of football in other countries try similar tactics.
 <|endoftext|> 
User: I think at the highest level of sports that athletes are so tuned in that the only thing that might throw them off is their own mistake or the refs.
Bot: Yes, for example, former Patriots QB Benjarvus Green-Ellis never fumbled in his NFL career.
 <|endoftext|> 
User: That's an amazing stat and he had one of the best nicknames ever, The Law Firm.
Bot: That's certainly an interesting one; was it a reference to his offensive abilities? 
 <|endoftext|> 
User: It was because his name sounded like a law firm haha. The Law Firm of Ben-Jarvis Green-Ellis.
Bot: Yeah, that would make for a confusing on-air name as a broadcaster if people thought it was an advertisement, especially on the radio haha.
 <|endoftext|> 
User: Yes it would, it wasn't used a ton just to bring a little humor into the broadcast.
Bot: It would probably read easier on a platform like facebook--I don't think they have a character limit for names.
 <|endoftext|> 
User: I've never really explored that, my name isn't very long to begin with so I never ran into that issue.
Bot: The site does have some interesting quirks; for example, the primary color is blue because Mark Zuckerberg is red-green colorblind 
 <|endoftext|> 
User: I remember an NFL game where the two teams wore red and green jerseys. A lot of people who suffered from that complained because they could not tell who were on what team.
Bot: That's funny--maybe it's part of why a home team wears white a lot of the time. I don't think many NCAA teams have green as a color, although a lot have red, like Ohio State.
 <|endoftext|> 
User: Yeah this was a special game where they were testing Color Rush jerseys that were primarily one color. That's why so many people had trouble because there were no breaks in the color or noticeable logos.
Bot: I guess they make some choices to make things easier on the viewers; for example, ESPN actually won an Emmy for the superimposed yellow first down line shown on TV.
 <|endoftext|> 
User: Good Afternoon!
Bot: Hi there.  I just learned that a wealthy board member of the University of Virginia wanted to sponsor a shoe shopping day for female staff and some women were offended.  Virginia just cannot get a break.
 <|endoftext|> 
User: Isn't that the truth!  What was the reason behind a female only shopping spree?  I hope it wasn't nefarious 
Bot: It was to celebrate his Mom's 102 birthday.  The women objected because they want to choose the groups they associate with and this trip would jam them together arbitrarily.
 <|endoftext|> 
User: Interesting!
Bot: The guy had to resign from the board.  He just wanted to express generosity and have some people have some fun.  It was a strange turn of events.
 <|endoftext|> 
User: Like you said - nothing these days about the Commonwealth of Virginia surprises me any more!  That's amazing
Bot: Speaking of shopping for shoes, Stephon Marbury promoted a line of shoes that cost $15 and took no money for the endorsement.
 <|endoftext|> 
User: Starbury is a good dude, he played here in Phoenix and did a lot of good stuff in the community and was pretty selfless.  This does not surprise me, and I think I heard about it a while back.  Thought he was still playing in China?
Bot: I am in Ahwatukee myself.  Some shoes are safety equipment.  I have known men who wore steel toed shoes to protect against heavy items being dropped.
 <|endoftext|> 
User: For sure, very valuable in the construction industry!  I bet some of those shoes start to smell pretty bad after a few years of work!
Bot: Undoubtedly.  They say that dry tea bags will absorb the odor.  I wonder how long it takes.
 <|endoftext|> 
User: I guess there's always a double use for everything every made in the world.  I wonder how these things are discovered?!?!
Bot: Good point!  Did someone drop a tea bag and then did not notice it and one shoe smelled better compared to the other one?
 <|endoftext|> 
User: Right!  I guess we'll never know if it was science or accidents - shoes are pretty weird when you think about how diverse they are and pretty much everyone has several pairs and types
Bot: NFL wide receiver Steve Smith would leave his pair of cleats on the field after each game to remind people of the homeless who don't have shoes.
 <|endoftext|> 
User: Another good dude athlete!  I remember this gesture and how he didn't make a big deal about it until the media caught on.  
Bot: I just heard about it recently.  I did see him do some interviews and he came across as a good guy.  I also read that 5000 year old shoes perform better than modern shoes.  Another one of those, "How do the measure that?"
 <|endoftext|> 
User: Did someone walk a mile in someone's 5,000 year old shoes?  Great point, and they couldn't have been comfortable!
Bot: Yes, that's right.  Years ago, shoes were more for function and there is some of that now like the steel toed ones.  However, they are much more for fashion now than they used to be.
 <|endoftext|> 
User: Fashion for sure and the prices for some are crazy - I've seen "designer" sneakers for $500 - that's ridiculous!
Bot: It sure is.  When our kids moved out, I put in shoe racks and we now have a "shoe room" for my wife in what used to be a bedroom.  Nice conversation.  Thanks.
 <|endoftext|> 
User: Hi!  Do you know a lot about shoes?
Bot: A decent amount.  What about you?  Do you have a shoe preference?
 <|endoftext|> 
User: Not really.  I do have a problem though and maybe you can help me out.  My feet sweat really bad and they make my shoes smell really stinky.  Do you know of any tricks or tips I can do to help get rid of the unpleasant odor?
Bot: You can place dry tea bags in shoes and they will absorb the bad smell.  For real.
 <|endoftext|> 
User: Thank you so much!  I was about to pass out from the stench.  I wonder how they know that 5000 year old shoes perform better than modern shoes.
Bot: They must have tested them.  Leather shoes can be really resilient.
 <|endoftext|> 
User: I bet.  Pro ballet dancers can go through 4 pairs of pointe shoes in a week.  I bet that gets expensive.
Bot: Yes, but if they are professional, I think the ballet company pays for the shoes.  Do you prefer functional shoes or decorative fashionable shoes, or both?
 <|endoftext|> 
User: I'm a mixture of both.  Seems like the big money I spend for nice shoes ends up being a waste though because then I don't wear the shoes.  lol
Bot: Ha ha.  I like to buy moderately expensive high quality shoes on sale because they last longer.  Did you know that NFL player Steve Smith leaves his cleats on the field after every game to raise awareness about homeless people without shoes?
 <|endoftext|> 
User: That's pretty cool of him to do that.  I feel terrible when I see homeless people.  I can't even imagine what goes through their minds every day.
Bot: Same.  I wonder if he raises money to buy shoes to give away?
 <|endoftext|> 
User: He must.  I'll have to look it up.  Sephon Marbury promoted a line of shoes that retailed for $15 and he wasn't paid to endorse them.  I wonder if those were some kind of shoes for charity as well and that's why he did it for free?
Bot: I wonder.  Do you prefer American football or soccer or both?
 <|endoftext|> 
User: I prefer football over soccer. lol
Bot: I prefer soccer.  I especially enjoy watching the World Cup games, both the men's and women's World Cups.
 <|endoftext|> 
User: I'll watch the world cup games.  I wonder why americans call it soccer but the rest of the world calls it football?
Bot: Probably because elsewhere in the world they don't really watch American football.  Rugby is popular around the world though. What is your favorite American football team?
 <|endoftext|> 
User: My favorite team is the steelers.  Do you know what the highest scoring football game ever was?
Bot: I think it was in 1916 when Georgia Tech beat Cumberland 222-0!  Crazy!   No mercy for the other team!
 <|endoftext|> 
User: p
Bot: Did you know that professional bowlers in the 1960s made 2 times more than current football stars? Bowling must've been real popular then.
 <|endoftext|> 
User: Wow.  It was along with baseball and horse racing.  Thanks for chatting! 
Bot: Sure, have a good day!
 <|endoftext|> 
User: I love shoes, in fact I have a collection of them
Bot: Nice, are they as good as the 5000 years old ones?
 <|endoftext|> 
User: I dont think so lol, but they look nice that I can tell you
Bot: Nice :). did you know ballet dancers go through 4 pairs of shoes a week?
 <|endoftext|> 
User: No I didnt, they must spend a fortune on shoes, good thing I dont like ballet lol
Bot: Yeah they must. how to you keep your shoes free of smells
 <|endoftext|> 
User: I use a spry and also dry tea bags, its a great way to absorb all those bad smells, highly recommended
Bot: Nice, good to know. DO you know who steve smith is?
 <|endoftext|> 
User: No not really, who is he?
Bot: An nfl player who always leaves his cleats in the field after the game to raise awareness about homelessness
 <|endoftext|> 
User: Oh so thats him, I remember now his a wide receiver and not only a great player but it seems like a great person as well
Bot: yeah he is doing what he loves while doing something great for the community
 <|endoftext|> 
User: I agree so do you also know the player Benjarvus Green Ellis?
Bot: Yeah , he is the guy that never fumbled a football in his career
 <|endoftext|> 
User: Yeah the same one, he played for the Patriots, his one of the best players I have seen at least on the RB position.
Bot: Yeah that is amazing. U of Iowa locker room is apparently pink, the visitors one
 <|endoftext|> 
User: Thats funny, I wonder how the other teams take that, its hard to be tough in a pink room
Bot: I know it is supposed to be some kind of distraction i think
 <|endoftext|> 
User: I wonder if the tactic works, the other team might get angry because it seems a bit insulting anyways back in the 60s bowlers made more money than football players
Bot: Yeah, I know. Do you know who the wealthiest presidents of the us are?
 <|endoftext|> 
User: Im guessin Trump, JFK and Jefferson
Bot: Actually trump is not in there, bu Washington is
 <|endoftext|> 
User: Hello there, do you watch much television?
Bot: I love tv. How about you. Whats your favorite show.
 <|endoftext|> 
User: Yeah same here, I love tv. I would have to say either Seinfeld or the Simpsons are my all time favs, how about you?
Bot: Never cared for seinfeld myself. I love the simpsons. Did you know there is only one episode where bart isnt in the show or mentioned.
 <|endoftext|> 
User: I think I have heard about that before, but pretty sure I have never seen that one. 
Bot: I have seen a lot of epeiodes of the simpsons. I dont remember seeing that one either.
 <|endoftext|> 
User: Yeah I think Simpsons should have done like Seinfeld and quit while they were still very funny, I think after season 10 it started going downhill. 
Bot: I never really thought seinfeld was funny. I liked cramer he was funny. I could wathc the simpsons anytime. Homer is always funny.
 <|endoftext|> 
User: Yeah the Simpsons is just classic.  Have you ever seen Pokemon?
Bot: I have not actually. I do know there are over 750 episodes. thats about 50 a year for 16 years. It was pretty popular. 
 <|endoftext|> 
User: Yeah isn't that just crazy how many there are?  I wonder how they keep coming up with new material after all those shows. 
Bot: Well I think there are thousands of different pokemon. So they would have no shortage of characters toto make it new. throw in 
 <|endoftext|> 
User: Wow, well in that case yeah I guess they could just pick a character and make a few shows out of that. 
Bot: Dont quote me on that number. I know there are a lot of them though. Were you a that 70s show fan?
 <|endoftext|> 
User: Yeah I really like that show when it first came out, have you ever seen it?
Bot: Yeah I thought it was pretty good. I guess they remade it over in the UK. It was canceled after 10 episodes.
 <|endoftext|> 
User: I heard it bombed over there when they tried yeah, I wonder why/ 
Bot: I guess it just didnt translate well. They remade the show verbatim so it was exactly what we saw here. Or maybe the actors werent very good.
 <|endoftext|> 
User: Yeah that could be it, I know the actors really made the show over here. 
Bot: I know I enjoyed it over here. Almost as much as my son loves Thomas the tank.
 <|endoftext|> 
User: Good Morning!
Bot: Good morning. How are you? So did you get a chance to watch the winter olympics at all last year?
 <|endoftext|> 
User: Yes I watched some of it. My favorite is the ice skating. I like the singles and the couples equally. I like Adam Rippon!
Bot: I didn't get a chance to watch a ton of it. I have small kids so I watch a lot of cartoons most nights but I did get to watch some. I'm not a huge skating fan but I don't mind it whenever the Olympics come on. Yeah Adam Rippon did pretty amazing.
 <|endoftext|> 
User: You would never guess that these amazing people are so nervous. They look so polished-like they never got scared.
Bot: Yeah it's true. They do look real calm. I feel like I would be freaking out if I were in that position.
 <|endoftext|> 
User: I would fall flat on my face. I did not know that he was gay. That must put him in a position to help other people who are gay to be cool with it.
Bot: Yeah. It seems like he used his sports platform to talk about the difficulties of being gay and the difficulties that a lot of younger people face.
 <|endoftext|> 
User: Yes, there is so much bullying that kids go through if they are different.
Bot: Yeah. I always worry about bullying when my kids get older. I know you can't protect your  kids forever but it's hard to see others treated badly because they may look or act different. 
 <|endoftext|> 
User: You have to stand behind them that's for sure. My son is gay but he never got bullied because he came out after high school. I have always stood behind him anyway. In high school the other kids were scared of him because he was a fighter.
Bot: Well that's one way to deal with bullying. Haha. I think it is very important to stand behind your kids and let them know you love them no matter what. 
 <|endoftext|> 
User: Kids need family support. As long as they are being themselves, they will learn to stand up to bullying. Most bullies are cowards, anyway.
Bot: That's true. I was looking at some interesting facts here. I didn't realize that the three wealthiest Presidents were JFK, Washington, and Jefferson. But I guess the two oldest owned massive amounts of land I'm sure.
 <|endoftext|> 
User: There was plenty of land to go around in those days. And the Kennedys got rich on Irish whiskey. I am from Massachusetts. lol
Bot: I guess you would know then. Haha. I just went to a Museum in Virginia not too long ago about the early settlers and they pretty much just gave away land for free back then to anyone who would come and settle there. Those were the days.
 <|endoftext|> 
User: Yes. I wish I was there. That was a great enticement for people to come from Europe. But it was hard living in those days. Not so easy to settle a new country.
Bot: No. It was very hard. We got to walk around the old settlements and they definitely had to work very hard and pretty much everything they had was from the land they lived off of.
 <|endoftext|> 
User: No grocery stores or Macys. haha Still, it must have been worth it because a lot of people came. They didn't have any entertainment either. No television and no Simpsons.
Bot: Yeah, What did they do with all their free time. Haha. They definitely had a strong work ethic. They had to or they wouldn't survive.
 <|endoftext|> 
User: They probably didn't have free time. Sunday mornings-but they all went to church. You couldn't be lazy or you wouldn't eat.
Bot: Well, I am going to head out here. It was very nice chatting with you today.
 <|endoftext|> 
User: Thank you-have a great day. Don't work too hard!
Bot: I'll try not too. 
 <|endoftext|> 
User: Do you watch television at all? 
Bot: I do. I like comedies, how about you? 
 <|endoftext|> 
User: I like comedies and dramas. Not big on Pokemon though
Bot: Me neither. But some people must like it since they made 750 episodes!
 <|endoftext|> 
User: I guess kids will watch anything. Have you watched That 70s Show?
Bot: I have. I heard it was remade in the UK and got cancelled!
 <|endoftext|> 
User: I'm not surprised. The show was very American. Sometimes it works well the other way. Three's Company was based on a UK show.
Bot: That's true. I didn't realize that. 
 <|endoftext|> 
User: Would you watch a show that used chickens to entertain audiences?
Bot: I don't think so. Haha. Cesar learned about chickens as entertainment in Britain. 
 <|endoftext|> 
User: Strange because chickens are so tasty. 
Bot: People do a lot of different things for entertainment! Do you play video games?
 <|endoftext|> 
User: I used to play. Don't play now. What's your favorite system?
Bot: I had an old Nintendo. They finally discontinued it in 2003. 
 <|endoftext|> 
User: Very popular system, even though it had only 54 colors. Much better than the Gameboy.
Bot: I wonder if they have video games at the White House?
 <|endoftext|> 
User: If there are kids in the White House, sure. Trump tends to watch TV a lot. I don't think he plays games.
Bot: I heard the guest house is bigger than the White House itself. I guess they have a lot of visitors. 
 <|endoftext|> 
User: These days, guests are probably getting fast food because of the gov't shut down.
Bot: That's true! It used to be that the runner up of the election became the Vice President! That would never work these days. 
 <|endoftext|> 
User: I imagine a lot of fighting all the time.
Bot: Yeah, I can see that! I learned a lot from you, thanks for chatting!
 <|endoftext|> 
User: Do you watch a lot of TV?
Bot: I do! I love game shows and sitcoms, but I am also a big fan of some cartoons.
 <|endoftext|> 
User: What cartoons do you like?
Bot: I really like American Dad, but some of the older episodes of South Park are really great. Did you know that when they aired their Family Guy episode, they received flowers from the crew of The Simpsons?
 <|endoftext|> 
User: I did not, it seems like they have a good relationship, thats great they are rivals but no need to fight
Bot: I think it's a pretty well-shared opinion in the cartoon world that Family Guy is a lazy show because so much of its humor is non-sequiturs. Have you ever watched Pokemon?
 <|endoftext|> 
User: I have, got to catch them all right? seems a bit impossible at this point 
Bot: Yes, kind of like 'catching' all of the undocumented immigrants, as some might put it. Did you see any of the President's speech on border security on TV today?
 <|endoftext|> 
User: I did, it seems like a waste of money to me, nor really worth it, do you support Trump?
Bot: Definitely not! It's odd that he claims he knows how to run a country on the basis that he's a rich businessman, and yet he's not even one of the three wealthiest presidents (JFK, Washington, Jefferson)
 <|endoftext|> 
User: Yeah, I think he is too stuborn and does whatever he wants. His guest house is larger than the white house its hard to believe he's not on that list
Bot: I guess it's kind of ironic that a man who owns all those hotels lives in a house smaller than his guest house haha. I bet he'd prefer an authoritarian regime where he could be a dictator who's just called a president.
 <|endoftext|> 
User: Yeah I agree it is ironic indeed, you know that up untill 1805 the runner up of an election would become Vice President!!!
Bot: Can you imagine Hillary Clinton as Trump's VP? Now that would be some can't miss entertainment! That would definitely hold the national audience's interest.
 <|endoftext|> 
User: We would have a civil war almost every week lol, its a good thing that has changed now, in my opinion Trump should use his time to record pop albums instead of trying to build an expensive and useless wall
Bot: Yes, The President Show on Comedy Central actually had a Christmas special that featured a fake Trump holiday album. If he didn't spend so much time on Twitter, maybe he could release 3 albums like the president of Indonesia has while in office
 <|endoftext|> 
User: That would be a great idea I might buy the album and maybe Trump will make it to the top 3 rank with the money of the sales
Bot: Yes, that would be one way to make money. Did you know that Ronald Reagan was once rejected for a movie role because he didn't look presidential enough? I wish that had happened with voters and Trump! 
 <|endoftext|> 
User: That is ironic lol, and I hope Trump doesn't get re-elected. I really don't understand why people vote for him.
Bot: I hope not! The first president of Zimbabwe was called President Banana, and based on the little I've read about him it seems like he wasn't a very effective leader and the country is still negatively impacted by his time in office. 
 <|endoftext|> 
User: So enough politics and more entertainment, did you ever own a nintendo system?
Bot: I did a long time ago, and SNES, too. Too bad they stopped making those consoles.
 <|endoftext|> 
User: Yeah they stopped making them back in 2003, its a shame but theres more advanced systems now
Bot: Yes, they display far more than the 54 colors the original had.
 <|endoftext|> 
User: Hi, how are you?
Bot: Well thank you. Do you enjoy any sports?
 <|endoftext|> 
User: I enjoy all sports. What about you?
Bot: I especially enjoy football and baseball. Do you enjoy any in particular?
 <|endoftext|> 
User: I really enjoy those. I like college and the NFL.
Bot: Football and the nfl are both very popular in the US. 14 of 25 of the largest stadiums belong to college football teams.
 <|endoftext|> 
User: Wow, I did not know it was that many. I know Michigan and OSU have huge stadiums but I am not sure I could name more. Maybe Oklahoma, Texas, Alabama???
Bot: I mean a high school football stadium in texas with 18K seats cost 60 million to build. Imagine how much it too to build those big college stadiums.
 <|endoftext|> 
User: Yeah! College teams have huge boosters though. Like Oregon has Phil Knight and Oklahoma State has T Booke Pickens...
Bot: These stadiums sure are a large investment. Even the huge american flags alone are 50k a pop
 <|endoftext|> 
User: That much!!! Holy cow! I wonder how much the pink paint iowa used to paint the visitors locker room cost?
Bot: I wonder if baseball stadiums cost just as much?
 <|endoftext|> 
User: No, not in college, They do not need the infrastructure that foot ball needs, in terms of seating.
Bot: Really? I though even college baseball have large stadiums. In any case, did you know a typical season uses up to 160k baseballs?
 <|endoftext|> 
User: That many! I went to a big ten school and they had maybe 100 people at the games. It was sparce...
Bot: Really? I imagined college baseball to be 3rd, only behind football and soccer, having at least several hundred to a thousand
 <|endoftext|> 
User: Not at Illinois... There was a guy who found $3M in baseball cards in his grandpa's attic!
Bot: Man it seems like forgotten attics are actually treasure troves. While I enjoy baseball, it seems they haven't done a good job making it far for women. A 17 year old female pitcher was banned from professional baseball after she struck out babe ruth and lou gehrig
 <|endoftext|> 
User: Banned for that? Are attics going to be the new storage unit?
Bot: Perhaps. On a different note, baseball have more fair rules to keep players from making bad choices. For instance if a player catches a baseball in their hat, the opposing team gets 3 bases.
 <|endoftext|> 
User: Are you a fan of football by any chance?
Bot: Yes I actually am, I am a fan of the Patriots, what about you?
 <|endoftext|> 
User: I am. Bears fan here. Were you aware that the Patriots had a player that never fumbled the ball his entire career?
Bot: I am aware I became a fan because of him, Benjarvus Green Ellis, what a great player.
 <|endoftext|> 
User: That is such a shocking statistic. He was a running back right?
Bot: Yeah he was a running back that is correct, did you hear about the team that lost by 222 points, that was a serious defeat!!
 <|endoftext|> 
User: I did. It was Cumberland that lost. I do not know how it is possible to score that many points in a game. 
Bot: I know! the other team's coach really underperformed or the whole team was underslept
 <|endoftext|> 
User: Apparently. In the 60's bowlers made more than football players. I can't imagine that bowling was ever that popular. 
Bot: Or maybe football players didnt earn that much to begin with, have you ever been to the University of Iowa? turns out the visiting team locker room is completely pink.
 <|endoftext|> 
User: I have not but that's some kind of psychological warfare ha ha. I watch a lot of television even when football is not on. Do you?
Bot: It must be, it definetely makes you think twice, and I do as well I love TV mostly cartoons or animated series though.
 <|endoftext|> 
User: I like adult animated series like Archer and South Park. Apparently when South Park did their Family Guy episode the Simpsons crew sent them flowers which is hilarious. 
Bot: That is hilarious and I love both shows I also like Pokemon, but mostly the 150 original Pokemons.
 <|endoftext|> 
User: I can't believe there were so many. How many years was it on?
Bot: It's like 750 Pokemon episodes and its been around 16 years since it first aired so quite a long time and its still successfull.
 <|endoftext|> 
User: Wow, it does not seem like that long. Since I mentioned The Simpsons earlier, there is only one episode where Bart does not appear and is not mentioned. With as long as that has been on that's so shocking. 
Bot: I havent seen that episode, I might google it later, and yeah The Simpsons has over 600 episodes.
 <|endoftext|> 
User: I don't think I have either. That's an insane amount of episodes. Did you ever see Thomas the Tank Engine?
Bot: I did, my little brother used to love Thomas the Tank Engine, I remember it had great narrators.
 <|endoftext|> 
User: It did. Ringo Starr, George Carlin, and Alec Baldwin have all narrated for them.
Bot: Null <|endoftext|>
